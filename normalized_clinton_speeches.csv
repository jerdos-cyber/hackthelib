0,how are you donald well thank you lester and thanks to hofstra for hosting us the central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we\ll build together today is my granddaughter\ second birthday so i think about this a lot first we have to build an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top that means we need new jobs good jobs with rising incomes i want us to invest in you i want us to invest in your future that means jobs in infrastructure in advanced manufacturing innovation and technology clean renewable energy and small business because most of the new jobs will come from small business we also have to make the economy fairer that starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee finally equal pay for women\ work i also want to see more companies do profitsharing if you help create the profits you should be able to share in them not just the executives at the top and i want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work i\ve heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you\re under so let\ have paid family leave earned sick days let\ be sure we have affordable child care and debtfree college how are we going to do it we\re going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes finally we tonight are on the stage together donald trump and i donald it\ good to be with you we\re going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country you have to judge us who can shoulder the immense awesome responsibilities of the presidency who can put into action the plans that will make your life better i hope that i will be able to earn your vote on november 8th well i think that trade is an important issue of course we are 5 percent of the world\ population we have to trade with the other 95 percent and we need to have smart fair trade deals we also though need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions and the kind of plan that donald has put forth would be trickledown economics all over again in fact it would be the most extreme version the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we\ve ever had i call it trumpedup trickledown because that\ exactly what it would be that is not how we grow the economy we just have a different view about what\ best for growing the economy how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes i think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives i understand that you know donald was very fortunate in his life and that\ all to his benefit he started his business with 14 million borrowed from his father and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people the better off we\ll be and that everything will work out from there i don\t buy that i have a different experience my father was a smallbusinessman he worked really hard he printed drapery fabrics on long tables where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going and so what i believe is the more we can do for the middle class the more we can invest in you your education your skills your future the better we will be off and the better we\ll grow that\ the kind of economy i want us to see again well let\ stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago we had the worst financial crisis the great recession the worst since the 1930s that was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy failed to invest in the middle class took their eyes off of wall street and created a perfect storm in fact donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis he said back in 2006 gee i hope it does collapse because then i can go in and buy some and make some money well it did collapse nine million people  nine million people lost their jobs five million people lost their homes and 13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out now we have come back from that abyss and it has not been easy so we\re now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place independent experts have looked at what i\ve proposed and looked at what donald\ proposed and basically they\ve said this that if his tax plan which would blow up the debt by over 5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middleclass families compared to the wealthy were to go into effect we would lose 35 million jobs and maybe have another recession they\ve looked at my plans and they\ve said ok if we can do this and i intend to get it done we will have 10 million more new jobs because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy take clean energy some country is going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the chinese i think it\ real i think science is real and i think it\ important that we grip this and deal with it both at home and abroad and here\ what we can do we can deploy a half a billion more solar panels we can have enough clean energy to power every home we can build a new modern electric grid that\ a lot of jobs that\ a lot of new economic activity so i\ve tried to be very specific about what we can and should do and i am determined that we\re going to get the economy really moving again building on the progress we\ve made over the last eight years but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place well actually well actually i have thought about this quite a bit and i have  well not quite that long i think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s i think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again  million new jobs a balanced budget incomes went up for everybody manufacturing jobs went up also in the 1990s if we\re actually going to look at the facts when i was in the senate i had a number of trade deals that came before me and i held them all to the same test will they create jobs in america will they raise incomes in america and are they good for our national security some of them i voted for the biggest one a multinational one known as cafta i voted against and because i hold the same standards as i look at all of these trade deals but let\ not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy i think it is a part of it and i\ve said what i\m going to do i\m going to have a special prosecutor we\re going to enforce the trade deals we have and we\re going to hold people accountable when i was secretary of state we actually increased american exports globally 30 percent we increased them to china 50 percent so i know how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs well i\ve been a senator donald and i have been a secretary of state and i have done a lot well that\ your opinion that is your opinion well that is just not accurate i was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out i wrote about that in no well donald i know you live in your own reality but that is not the facts the facts are  i did say i hoped it would be a good deal but when it was negotiated  which i was not responsible for i concluded it wasn\t i wrote about that in my book  before you even announced look there are differences there are there are different views about what\ good for our country our economy and our leadership in the world and i think it\ important to look at what we need to do to get the economy going again that\ why i said new jobs with rising incomes investments not in more tax cuts that would add 5 trillion to the debt but in  oh but i do in fact i have written a book about it it\ called stronger together you can pick it up tomorrow at a bookstore  or at an airport near you but it\ because i see this  we need to have strong growth fair growth sustained growth we also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business so we have a very robust set of plans and people have looked at both of our plans have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 35 million jobs and explode the debt which would have a recession that can\t  that can\t be left to stand i kind of assumed that there would be a lot of these charges and claims and so so we have taken the home page of my website hillaryclintoncom and we\ve turned it into a factchecker so if you want to see in realtime what the facts are please go and take a look because what i have proposed  would not add a penny to the debt and your plans would add 5 trillion to the debt what i have proposed would cut regulations and streamline them for small businesses what i have proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy because they have made all the gains in the economy and i think it\ time that the wealthy and corporations paid their fair share to support this country well at least i have a plan to fight isis no we\re not no we\re not that\ a  that\  go to the  please fact checkers get to work i have a feeling that by the end of this evening i\m going to be blamed for everything that\ ever happened why not yeah why not you know just join the debate by saying more crazy things now let me say this it is absolutely the case yeah well let\ start the clock again lester we\ve looked at your tax proposals i don\t see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals you\re referring to that would cause the repatriation bringing back of money that\ stranded overseas i happen to support that i happen to  i happen to support that in a way that will actually work to our benefit but when i look at what you have proposed you have what is called now the trump loophole because it would so advantage you and the business you do you\ve proposed an approach that has a  4 billion tax benefit for your family and when you look at what you are proposing  it is  as i said trumpedup trickledown trickledown did not work it got us into the mess we were in in 2008 and 2009 slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn\t worked and a lot of really smart wealthy people know that and they are saying hey we need to do more to make the contributions we should be making to rebuild the middle class i don\t think topdown works in america i think building the middle class investing in the middle class making college debtfree so more young people can get their education helping people refinance their  their debt from college at a lower rate those are the kinds of things that will really boost the economy broadbased inclusive growth is what we need in america not more advantages for people at the very top well i think you\ve seen another example of baitand switch here for 40 years everyone running for president has released their tax returns you can go and see nearly i think 39 40 years of our tax returns but everyone has done it we know the irs has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when you\re under audit so you\ve got to ask yourself why won\t he release his tax returns and i think there may be a couple of reasons first maybe he\ not as rich as he says he is second maybe he\ not as charitable as he claims to be third we don\t know all of his business dealings but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about 650 million to wall street and foreign banks or maybe he doesn\t want the american people all of you watching tonight to know that he\ paid nothing in federal taxes because the only years that anybody\ ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license and they showed he didn\t pay any federal income tax so if he\ paid zero that means zero for troops zero for vets zero for schools or health and i think probably he\ not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are because it must be something really important even terrible that he\ trying to hide and the financial disclosure statements they don\t give you the tax rate they don\t give you all the details that tax returns would and it just seems to me that this is something that the american people deserve to see and i have no reason to believe that he\ ever going to release his tax returns because there\ something he\ hiding and we\ll guess we\ll keep guessing at what it might be that he\ hiding but i think the question is were he ever to get near the white house what would be those conflicts who does he owe money to well he owes you the answers to that and he should provide them i do you know i made a mistake using a private e mail trump and if i had to do it over again i would obviously do it differently but i\m not going to make any excuses it was a mistake and i take responsibility for that and maybe because you haven\t paid any federal income tax for a lot of years and the other thing i think is important  is if your  if your main claim to be president of the united states is your business then i think we should talk about that you know your campaign manager said that you built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys and indeed i have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses donald i\ve met dishwashers painters architects glass installers marble installers drapery installers like my dad was who you refused to pay when they finished the work that you asked them to do we have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses it\ a beautiful facility it immediately was put to use and you wouldn\t pay what the man needed to be paid what he was charging you to do well to do the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor taken the goods that they produced and then refused to pay them i can only say that i\m certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you he provided a good middleclass life for us but the people he worked for he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides and when we talk about your business you\ve taken business bankruptcy six times there are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once you call yourself the king of debt you talk about leverage you even at one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the united states well sometimes there\ not a direct transfer of skills from business to government but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government and we need to be very clear about that well you\re right race remains a significant challenge in our country unfortunately race still determines too much often determines where people live determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get and yes it determines how they\re treated in the criminal justice system we\ve just seen those two tragic examples in both tulsa and charlotte and we\ve got to do several things at the same time we have to restore trust between communities and the police we have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training the best techniques that they\re well prepared to use force only when necessary everyone should be respected by the law and everyone should respect the law right now that\ not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods so i have ever since the first day of my campaign called for criminal justice reform i\ve laid out a platform that i think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system but we also have to recognize in addition to the challenges that we face with policing there are so many good brave police officers who equally want reform so we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal and we\ve got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them the gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young african american men more than the next nine causes put together so we have to do two things as i said we have to restore trust we have to work with the police we have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them and we have to tackle the plague of gun violence which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we\re seeing today well i\ve heard  i\ve heard donald say this at his rallies and it\ really unfortunate that he paints such a dire negative picture of black communities in our country you know the vibrancy of the black church the black businesses that employ so many people the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids there\ a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up but we do always have to make sure we keep people safe there are the right ways of doing it and then there are ways that are ineffective stopandfrisk was found to be unconstitutional and in part because it was ineffective it did not do what it needed to do now i believe in community policing and in fact violent crime is onehalf of what it was in 1991 property crime is down 40 percent we just don\t want to see it creep back up we\ve had 25 years of very good cooperation but there were some problems some unintended consequences too many young africanamerican and latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses and it\ just a fact that if you\re a young africanamerican man and you do the same thing as a young white man you are more likely to be arrested charged convicted and incarcerated so we\ve got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system we cannot just say law and order we have to say  we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system deal with mandatory minimum sentences which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little we need to have more second chance programs i\m glad that we\re ending private prisons in the federal system i want to see them ended in the state system you shouldn\t have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young americans so there are some positive ways we can work on this and i believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us right now  and this is something donald has supported along with the gun lobby  right now we\ve got too many military style weapons on the streets in a lot of places our police are outgunned we need comprehensive background checks and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm and we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who\ on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country if you\re too dangerous to fly you are too dangerous to buy a gun so there are things we can do and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way lester i think implicit bias is a problem for everyone not just police i think unfortunately too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other and therefore i think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about you know why am i feeling this way but when it comes to policing since it can have literally fatal consequences i have said in my first budget we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers i\ve met with a group of very distinguished experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago they admit it\ an issue they\ve got a lot of concerns mental health is one of the biggest concerns because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street they want support they want more training they want more assistance and i think the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that well it\ also fair to say if we\re going to talk about mayors that under the current mayor crime has continued to drop including murders so there is no i\m not new york  new york has done an excellent job and i give credit  i give credit across the board going back two mayors two police chiefs because it has worked and other communities need to come together to do what will work as well look one murder is too many but it is important that we learn about what has been effective and not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe but let\ also add no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods and so we need to do a better job of working again with the communities faith communities business communities as well as the police to try to deal with this problem well i  i do think i think  i think  i think donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate and yes i did and you know what else i prepared for i prepared to be president and i think that\ a good thing well just listen to what you heard and clearly as donald just admitted he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage and lester holt was going to be asking us questions so he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed but it can\t be dismissed that easily he has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an american citizen there was absolutely no evidence for it but he persisted he persisted year after year because some of his supporters people that he was trying to bring into his fold apparently believed it or wanted to believe it but remember donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the justice department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to africanamericans and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy he actually was sued twice by the justice department so he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior and the birther lie was a very hurtful one you know barack obama is a man of great dignity and i could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him but i like to remember what michelle obama said in her amazing speech at our democratic national convention when they go low we go high and barack obama went high despite donald trump\ best efforts to bring him down well i think cyber security cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president because clearly we\re facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries there are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they can use to make money but increasingly we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states organs of states the most recent and troubling of these has been russia there\ no doubt now that russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country and i am deeply concerned about this i know donald\ very praiseworthy of vladimir putin but putin is playing a really  tough long game here and one of the things he\ done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files to hack into personal files hack into the democratic national committee and we recently have learned that you know that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information we need to make it very clear  whether it\ russia china iran or anybody else  the united states has much greater capacity and we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information our privatesector information or our publicsector information and we\re going to have to make it clear that we don\t want to use the kinds of tools that we have we don\t want to engage in a different kind of warfare but we will defend the citizens of this country and the russians need to understand that i think they\ve been treating it as almost a probing how far would we go how much would we do and that\ why i was so  i was so shocked when donald publicly invited putin to hack into americans that is just unacceptable it\ one of the reasons why 50 national security officials who served in republican information  in administrations  have said that donald is unfit to be the commander inchief it\ comments like that that really worry people who understand the threats that we face well i think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing i have put forth a plan to defeat isis it does involve going after them online i think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent isis and their operatives from being able to use the internet to radicalize even direct people in our country and europe and elsewhere but we also have to intensify our air strikes against isis and eventually support our arab and kurdish partners to be able to actually take out isis in raqqa end their claim of being a caliphate we\re making progress our military is assisting in iraq and we\re hoping that within the year we\ll be able to push isis out of iraq and then you know really squeeze them in syria but we have to be cognizant of the fact that they\ve had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them foreign money foreign weapons so we have to make this the top priority and i would also do everything possible to take out their leadership i was involved in a number of efforts to take out al qaida leadership when i was secretary of state including of course taking out bin laden and i think we need to go after baghdadi as well make that one of our organizing principles because we\ve got to defeat isis and we\ve got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online well i hope the factcheckers are turning up the volume and really working hard donald supported the invasion of iraq that is absolutely proved over and over again he actually advocated for the actions we took in libya and urged that gadhafi be taken out after actually doing some business with him one time but the larger point  and he says this constantly  is george w bush made the agreement about when american troops would leave iraq not barack obama and the only way that american troops could have stayed in iraq is to get an agreement from the theniraqi government that would have protected our troops and the iraqi government would not give that but let\ talk about the question you asked lester the question you asked is what do we do here in the united states that\ the most important part of this how do we prevent attacks how do we protect our people and i think we\ve got to have an intelligence surge where we are looking for every scrap of information i was so proud of law enforcement in new york in minnesota in new jersey you know they responded so quickly so professionally to the attacks that occurred by rahami and they brought him down and we may find out more information because he is still alive which may prove to be an intelligence benefit so we\ve got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from europe from the middle east that means we\ve got to work more closely with our allies and that\ something that donald has been very dismissive of we\re working with nato the longest military alliance in the history of the world to really turn our attention to terrorism we\re working with our friends in the middle east many of which as you know are muslim majority nations donald has consistently insulted muslims abroad muslims at home when we need to be cooperating with muslim nations and with the american muslim community they\re on the front lines they can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else they need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities not be alienated and pushed away as some of donald\ rhetoric unfortunately has led to lester we\ve covered we\ve covered this ground whew ok let\ talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by donald first nato you know nato as a military alliance has something called article 5 and basically it says this an attack on one is an attack on all and you know the only time it\ ever been invoked after 9/11 when the 28 nations of nato said that they would go to afghanistan with us to fight terrorism something that they still are doing by our side with respect to iran when i became secretary of state iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb they had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the bush administration they had built covert facilities they had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away and we had sanctioned them i voted for every sanction against iran when i was in the senate but it wasn\t enough so i spent a yearandahalf putting together a coalition that included russia and china to impose the toughest sanctions on iran and we did drive them to the negotiating table and my successor john kerry and president obama got a deal that put a lid on iran\ nuclear program without firing a single shot that\ diplomacy that\ coalitionbuilding that\ working with other nations the other day i saw donald saying that there were some iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of iran and they were taunting american sailors who were on a nearby ship he said you know if they taunted our sailors i\d blow them out of the water and start another war that\ not good judgment that is not the right temperament to be commanderin chief to be taunted and the worst part  of what we heard donald say has been about nuclear weapons he has said repeatedly that he didn\t care if other nations got nuclear weapons japan south korea even saudi arabia it has been the policy of the united states democrats and republicans to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons he even said well you know if there were nuclear war in east asia well you know that\ fine  have a good time folks and in fact his cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling that is the numberone threat we face in the world and it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material so a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes as far as i think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned it\ a good one though it well describes the problem well let me  let me start by saying words matter words matter when you run for president and they really matter when you are president and i want to reassure our allies in japan and south korea and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them it is essential that america\ word be good and so i know that this campaign has caused some questioning and worries on the part of many leaders across the globe i\ve talked with a number of them but i want to  on behalf of myself and i think on behalf of a majority of the american people say that you know our word is good it\ also important that we look at the entire global situation there\ no doubt that we have other problems with iran but personally i\d rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be facing that and donald never tells you what he would do would he have started a war would he have bombed iran if he\ going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to iranian facilities that we never had before then he should tell us what his alternative would be but it\ like his plan to defeat isis he says it\ a secret plan but the only secret is that he has no plan so we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues people around the word follow our presidential campaigns so closely trying to get hints about what we will do can they rely on us are we going to lead the world with strength and in accordance with our values that\ what i intend to do i intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on both here at home and around the world to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity but also stand up to bullies whether they\re abroad or at home we cannot let those who would try to destabilize the world to interfere with american interests and security  to be given any opportunities at all well as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal a ceasefire a release of dissidents an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee he can talk to me about stamina well one thing one thing lester you know he tried to switch from looks to stamina but this is a man who has called women pigs slobs and dogs and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers who has said  women don\t deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men and one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest he loves beauty contests supporting them and hanging around them and he called this woman miss piggy then he called her miss housekeeping because she was latina donald she has a name her name is alicia machado and she has become a us citizen and you can bet well i support our democracy and sometimes you win sometimes you lose but i certainly will support the outcome of this election and i know donald\ trying very hard to plant doubts about it but i hope the people out there understand this election\ really up to you it\ not about us so much as it is about you and your families and the kind of country and future you want so i sure hope you will get out and vote as though your future depended on it because i think it does
1,well thank you are you a teacher yes i think that that\ a very good question because i\ve heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign and i think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we\re good and we are going to respect one another lift each other up we are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl as well as every adult to bring them in to working on behalf of our country i have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together that\ why the slogan of my campaign is stronger together because i think if we work together if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets americans against one another and instead we make some big goals  and i\ve set forth some big goals getting the economy to work for everyone not just those at the top making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable and so much else if we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them there\ nothing in my opinion that america can\t do so that\ why i hope that we will come together in this campaign obviously i\m hoping to earn your vote i\m hoping to be elected in november and i can promise you i will work with every american i want to be the president for all americans regardless of your political beliefs where you come from what you look like your religion i want us to heal our country and bring it together because that\ i think the best way for us to get the future that our children and our grandchildren deserve  well like everyone else i\ve spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw you know with prior republican nominees for president i disagreed with them on politics policies principles but i never questioned their fitness to serve donald trump is different i said starting back in june that he was not fit to be president and commanderinchief and many republicans and independents have said the same thing what we all saw and heard on friday was donald talking about women what he thinks about women what he does to women and he has said that the video doesn\t represent who he is but i think it\ clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is because we\ve seen this throughout the campaign we have seen him insult women we\ve seen him rate women on their appearance ranking them from one to ten we\ve seen him embarrass women on tv and on twitter we saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former miss universe in the harshest most personal terms so yes this is who donald trump is but it\ not only women and it\ not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president because he has also targeted immigrants african americans latinos people with disabilities pows muslims and so many others so this is who donald trump is and the question for us the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are that\ why  to go back to your question  i want to send a message  we all should  to every boy and girl and indeed to the entire world that america already is great but we are great because we are good and we will respect one another and we will work with one another and we will celebrate our diversity  these are very important values to me because this is the america that i know and love and i can pledge to you tonight that this is the america that i will serve if i\m so fortunate enough to become your president  well first let me start by saying that so much of what he\ just said is not right but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses he gets to decide what he wants to talk about instead of answering people\ questions talking about our agenda laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country that\ his choice when i hear something like that i am reminded of what my friend michelle obama advised us all when they go low you go high and look if this were just about one video maybe what he\ saying tonight would be understandable but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women but he never apologizes for anything to anyone  he never apologized to mr and mrs khan the gold star family whose son captain khan died in the line of duty in iraq and donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion he never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in indiana but donald said he couldn\t be trusted to be a judge because his parents were quote mexican he never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching and he never apologized for the racist lie that president obama was not born in the united states of america he owes the president an apology he owes our country an apology and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words   because everything he just said is absolutely false but i\m not surprised  in the first debate  i told people that it would be impossible to be factchecking donald all the time i\d never get to talk about anything i want to do and how we\re going to really make lives better for people so once again go to hillaryclintoncom we have literally trump  you can fact check him in real time last time at the first debate we had millions of people fact checking so i expect we\ll have millions more fact checking because you know it is  it\ just awfully good that someone with the temperament of donald trump is not in charge of the law in our country  well martha first let me say  and i\ve said before but i\ll repeat it because i want everyone to hear it  that was a mistake and i take responsibility for using a personal email account obviously if i were to do it over again i would not i\m not making any excuses it was a mistake and i am very sorry about that but i think it\ also important to point out where there are some misleading accusations from critics and others after a yearlong investigation there is no evidence that anyone hacked the server i was using and there is no evidence that anyone can point to at all  anyone who says otherwise has no basis  that any classified material ended up in the wrong hands i take classified materials very seriously and always have when i was on the senate armed services committee i was privy to a lot of classified material obviously as secretary of state i had some of the most important secrets that we possess such as going after bin laden so i am very committed to taking classified information seriously and as i said there is no evidence that any classified information ended up in the wrong hands  look it\ just not true and so please go to  it was personal emails not official  not  well we turned over 35000 so  yes that\ true i didn\t  i didn\t in the first debate and i\m going to try not to in this debate because i\d like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about  ok donald i know you\re into big diversion tonight anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way it\ exploding and the way republicans are leaving you but let\ at least focus   on some of the issues that people care about tonight let\ get to their questions  if he wants to start he can start no go ahead donald  well i think donald was about to say he\ going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the affordable care act and i\m going to fix it because i agree with you premiums have gotten too high copays deductibles prescription drug costs and i\ve laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down but here\ what i don\t want people to forget when we\re talking about reining in the costs which has to be the highest priority of the next president when the affordable care act passed it wasn\t just that 20 million got insurance who didn\t have it before but that in and of itself was a good thing i meet these people all the time and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families but everybody else the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employees got big benefits number one insurance companies can\t deny you coverage because of a preexisting condition number two no lifetime limits which is a big deal if you have serious health problems number three women can\t be charged more than men for our health insurance which is the way it used to be before the affordable care act number four if you\re under 26 and your parents have a policy you can be on that policy until the age of 26 something that didn\t happen before so i want very much to save what works and is good about the affordable care act but we\ve got to get costs down we\ve got to provide additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance but if we repeal it as donald has proposed and start over again all of those benefits i just mentioned are lost to everybody not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange and then we would have to start all over again right now we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage that\ the highest we\ve ever been in our country  so i want us to get to 100 percent but get costs down and keep quality up  no i mean he clarified what he meant and it\ very clear look we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again we might come up with a different system but we have an employerbased system that\ where the vast majority of people get their health care and the affordable care act was meant to try to fill the gap between people who were too poor and couldn\t put together any resources to afford health care namely people on medicaid obviously medicare which is a singlepayer system which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it by the way and then all of the people who were employed but people who were working but didn\t have the money to afford insurance and didn\t have anybody an employer or anybody else to help them that was the slot that the obamacare approach was to take and like i say 20 million people now have health insurance so if we just rip it up and throw it away what donald\ not telling you is we just turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be and that means the insurance companies   get to do pretty much whatever they want including saying look i\m sorry you\ve got diabetes you had cancer your child has asthma   you may not be able to have insurance because you can\t afford it so let\ fix what\ broken about it but let\ not throw it away and give it all back to the insurance companies and the drug companies that\ not going to work  well thank you for asking your question and i\ve heard this question from a lot of muslimamericans across our country because unfortunately there\ been a lot of very divisive dark things said about muslims and even someone like captain khan the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the united states army has been subject to attack by donald i want to say just a couple of things first we\ve had muslims in america since george washington and we\ve had many successful muslims we just lost a particular wellknown one with muhammad ali  my vision of america is an america where everyone has a place if you\re willing to work hard you do your part you contribute to the community that\ what america is that\ what we want america to be for our children and our grandchildren it\ also very shortsighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that donald has about muslims we need american muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines i\ve worked with a lot of different muslim groups around america i\ve met with a lot of them and i\ve heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country part of our homeland security and that\ what i want to see it\ also important i intend to defeat isis to do so in a coalition with majority muslim nations right now a lot of those nations are hearing what donald says and wondering why should we cooperate with the americans and this is a gift to isis and the terrorists violent jihadist terrorists we are not at war with islam and it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are so i want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else  well first of all i will not let anyone into our country that i think poses a risk to us but there are a lot of refugees women and children  think of that picture we all saw of that 4yearold boy with the blood on his forehead because he\d been bombed by the russian and syrian air forces there are children suffering in this catastrophic war largely i believe because of russian aggression and we need to do our part we by no means are carrying anywhere near the load that europe and others are but we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals our intelligence experts and others but it is important for us as a policy you know not to say as donald has said we\re going to ban people based on a religion how do you do that we are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty how do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own county are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country and how do we expect to be able to implement those so i thought that what he said was extremely unwise and even dangerous and indeed you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorists sites and what donald trump says about muslims is used to recruit fighters because they want to create a war between us and the final thing i would say this is the 10th or 12th time that he\ denied being for the war in iraq we have it on tape the entire press corps has looked at it it\ been debunked but it never stops him from saying whatever he wants to say  so please   go to hillaryclintoncom and you can see it  well right as i recall that was something i said about abraham lincoln after having seen the wonderful steven spielberg movie called lincoln it was a master class watching president lincoln get the congress to approve the 13th amendment it was principled and it was strategic and i was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it and yes president lincoln was trying to convince some people he used some arguments convincing other people he used other arguments that was a great  i thought a great display of presidential leadership but you know let\ talk about what\ really going on here martha because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the kremlin meaning putin and the russian government are directing the attacks the hacking on american accounts to influence our election and wikileaks is part of that as are other sites where the russians hack information we don\t even know if it\ accurate information and then they put it out we have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary a foreign power is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election and believe me they\re not doing it to get me elected they\re doing it to try to influence the election for donald trump  now maybe because he has praised putin maybe because he says he agrees with a lot of what putin wants to do maybe because he wants to do business in moscow i don\t know the reasons but we deserve answers and we should demand that donald release all of his tax returns so that people can see what are the entanglements and the financial relationships that he has   with the russians and other foreign powers  well everything you\ve heard just now from donald is not true i\m sorry i have to keep saying this but he lives in an alternative reality and it is sort of amusing to hear somebody who hasn\t paid federal income taxes in maybe 20 years talking about what he\ going to do but i\ll tell you what he\ going to do his plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they\ve ever had more than the bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two donald always takes care of donald and people like donald and this would be a massive gift and indeed the way that he talks about his tax cuts would end up raising taxes on middleclass families millions of middleclass families now here\ what i want to do i have said nobody who makes less than 250000 a year  and that\ the vast majority of americans as you know  will have their taxes raised because i think we\ve got to go where the money is and the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code and yes when i was a senator i did vote to close corporate loopholes i voted to close i think one of the loopholes he took advantage of when he claimed a billiondollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes i want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars it\ called the buffett rule yes warren buffett is the one who\ gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary i want to have a surcharge on incomes above 5 million we have to make up for lost times because i want to invest in you i want to invest in hardworking families and i think it\ been unfortunate but it\ happened that since the great recession the gains have all gone to the top and we need to reverse that people like donald who paid zero in taxes zero for our vets zero for our military zero for health and education that is wrong  and we\re going to make sure that nobody no corporation and no individual can get away without paying his fair share to support our country  well here we go again i\ve been in favor of getting rid of carried interest for years starting when i was a senator from new york but that\ not the point here  because i was a senator with a republican president  i will be the president and we will get it done that\ exactly right  you know under our constitution presidents have something called veto power look he has now said repeatedly 30 years this and 30 years that so let me talk about my 30 years in public service i\m very glad to do so eight million kids every year have health insurance because when i was first lady i worked with democrats and republicans to create the children\ health insurance program hundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because i worked to change our adoption and foster care system after 9/11 i went to work with republican mayor governor and president to rebuild new york and to get health care for our first responders who were suffering because they had run toward danger and gotten sickened by it hundreds of thousands of national guard and reserve members have health care because of work that i did and children have safer medicines because i was able to pass a law that required the dosing to be more carefully done when i was secretary of state i went around the world advocating for our country but also advocating for women\ rights to make sure that women had a decent chance to have a better life and negotiated a treaty with russia to lower nuclear weapons four hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when i was a senator for eight years i worked very hard and was very proud to be reelected in new york by an even bigger margin than i had been elected the first time and as president i will take that work that bipartisan work that finding common ground because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in washington  i\ve proven that i can and for 30 years i\ve produced results for people  well the situation in syria is catastrophic and every day that goes by we see the results of the regime by assad in partnership with the iranians on the ground the russians in the air bombarding places in particular aleppo where there are hundreds of thousands of people probably about 250000 still left and there is a determined effort by the russian air force to destroy aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the syrian rebels who are really holding out against the assad regime russia hasn\t paid any attention to isis they\re interested in keeping assad in power so i when i was secretary of state advocated and i advocate today a nofly zone and safe zones we need some leverage with the russians because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution unless there is some leverage over them and we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground but i want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of russia russia has decided that it\ all in in syria and they\ve also decided who they want to see become president of the united states too and it\ not me i\ve stood up to russia i\ve taken on putin and others and i would do that as president i think wherever we can cooperate with russia that\ fine and i did as secretary of state that\ how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons it\ how we got the sanctions on iran that put a lid on the iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot so i would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now but i do support the effort to investigate for crimes war crimes committed by the syrians and the russians and try to hold them accountable  no i wasn\t i was gone i hate to interrupt you but at some point  at some point we need to do some factchecking here  i would not use american ground forces in syria i think that would be a very serious mistake i don\t think american troops should be holding territory which is what they would have to do as an occupying force i don\t think that is a smart strategy i do think the use of special forces which we\re using the use of enablers and trainers in iraq which has had some positive effects are very much in our interests and so i do support what is happening but let me just  well martha i hope that by the time i  if i\m fortunate  i hope by the time i am president that we will have pushed isis out of iraq i do think that there is a good chance that we can take mosul and you know donald says he knows more about isis than the generals no he doesn\t there are a lot of very important planning going on and some of it is to signal to the sunnis in the area as well as kurdish peshmerga fighters that we all need to be in this and that takes a lot of planning and preparation i would go after baghdadi i would specifically target baghdadi because i think our targeting of al qaida leaders  and i was involved in a lot of those operations highly classified ones  made a difference so i think that could help i would also consider arming the kurds the kurds have been our best partners in syria as well as iraq and i know there\ a lot of concern about that in some circles but i think they should have the equipment they need so that kurdish and arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take raqqa after pushing isis out of iraq  well 67 percent of the people voted to reelect me when i ran for my second term and i was very proud and very humbled by that mr carter i have tried my entire life to do what i can to support children and families you know right out of law school i went to work for the children\ defense fund and donald talks a lot about you know the 30 years i\ve been in public service i\m proud of that you know i started off as a young lawyer working against discrimination against africanamerican children in schools and in the criminal justice system i worked to make sure that kids with disabilities could get a public education something that i care very much about i have worked with latinos  one of my first jobs in politics was down in south texas registering latino citizens to be able to vote so i have a deep devotion to use your absolutely correct word to making sure that an every american feels like he or she has a place in our country and i think when you look at the letters that i get a lot of people are worried that maybe they wouldn\t have a place in donald trump\ america they write me and one woman wrote me about her son felix she adopted him from ethiopia when he was a toddler he\ 10 years old now this is the only one country he\ ever known and he listens to donald on tv and he said to his mother one day will he send me back to ethiopia if he gets elected you know children listen to what is being said to go back to the very very first question and there\ a lot of fear  in fact teachers and parents are calling it the trump effect bullying is up a lot of people are feeling you know uneasy a lot of kids are expressing their concerns so first and foremost i will do everything i can to reach out to everybody  democrats republicans independents people across our country if you don\t vote for me i still want to be your president  i want to be the best president i can be for every american  well within hours i said that i was sorry about the way i talked about that because my argument is not with his supporters it\ with him and with the hateful and divisive campaign that he has run and the inciting of violence at his rallies and the very brutal kinds of comments about not just women but all americans all kinds of americans and what he has said about africanamericans and latinos about muslims about pows about immigrants about people with disabilities he\ never apologized for and so i do think that a lot of the tone and tenor that he has said  i\m proud of the campaign that bernie sanders and i ran we ran a campaign based on issues not insults and he is supporting me 100 percent  because we talked about what we wanted to do we might have had some differences and we had a lot of debates  no  well it\ not only my opinion it\ the opinion of many others national security experts republicans former republican members of congress but it\ in part because those of us who have had the great privilege of seeing this job up close and know how difficult it is and it\ not just because i watched my husband take a 300 billion deficit and turn it into a 200 billion surplus and 23 million new jobs were created and incomes went up for everybody everybody africanamerican incomes went up 33 percent and it\ not just because i worked with george w bush after 9/11 and i was very proud that when i told him what the city needed what we needed to recover he said you\ve got it and he never wavered he stuck with me and i have worked and i admire president obama he inherited the worst financial crisis since the great depression that was a terrible time for our country  nine million people lost their jobs  five million homes were lost  and 13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out we are back on the right track he would send us back into recession with his tax plans that benefit the wealthiest of americans  thank you well you\re right this is one of the most important issues in this election i want to appoint supreme court justices who understand the way the world really works who have reallife experience who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench but you know maybe they tried some more cases they actually understand what people are up against because i think the current court has gone in the wrong direction and so i would want to see the supreme court reverse citizens united and get dark unaccountable money out of our politics donald doesn\t agree with that i would like the supreme court to understand that voting rights are still a big problem in many parts of our country that we don\t always do everything we can to make it possible for people of color and older people and young people to be able to exercise their franchise i want a supreme court that will stick with roe v wade and a woman\ right to choose and i want a supreme court that will stick with marriage equality now donald has put forth the names of some people that he would consider and among the ones that he has suggested are people who would reverse roe v wade and reverse marriage equality i think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards i want a supreme court that doesn\t always side with corporate interests i want a supreme court that understands because you\re wealthy and you can give more money to something doesn\t mean you have any more rights or should have any more rights than anybody else so i have very clear views about what i want to see to kind of change the balance on the supreme court and i regret deeply that the senate has not done its job and they have not permitted a vote on the person that president obama a highly qualified person they\ve not given him a vote to be able to be have the full complement of nine supreme court justices i think that was a dereliction of duty i hope that they will see their way to doing it but if i am so fortunate enough as to be president i will immediately move to make sure that we fill that we have nine justices that get to work on behalf of our people  well  the question was about the supreme court and i just want to quickly say i respect the second amendment but i believe there should be comprehensive background checks and we should close the gun show loophole and close the online loophole  we have to save as many lives as we possibly can  and actually  well that was very interesting first of all china is illegally dumping steel in the united states and donald trump is buying it to build his buildings putting steelworkers and american steel plants out of business that\ something that i fought against as a senator and that i would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we don\t get taken advantage of by china on steel or anything else you know because it sounds like you\re in the business or you\re aware of people in the business  you know that we are now for the first time ever energyindependent we are not dependent upon the middle east but the middle east still controls a lot of the prices so the price of oil has been way down and that has had a damaging effect on a lot of the oil companies right we are however producing a lot of natural gas which serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels and i think that\ an important transition we\ve got to remain energyindependent it gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the middle east we have enough worries over there without having to worry about that so i have a comprehensive energy policy but it really does include fighting climate change because i think that is a serious problem and i support moving toward more clean renewable energy as quickly as we can because i think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses but i also want to be sure that we don\t leave people behind that\ why i\m the only candidate from the very beginning of this campaign who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country because those coal miners and their fathers and their grandfathers they dug that coal out a lot of them lost their lives they were injured but they turned the lights on and they powered their factories i don\t want to walk away from them so we\ve got to do something for them  but the price of coal is down worldwide so we have to look at this comprehensively  and that\ exactly what i have proposed i hope you will go to hillaryclintoncom and look at my entire policy  well i certainly will because i think that\ a very fair and important question look i respect his children his children are incredibly able and devoted and i think that says a lot about donald i don\t agree with nearly anything else he says or does but i do respect that and i think that is something that as a mother and a grandmother is very important to me so i believe that this election has become in part so  so conflictoriented so intense because there\ a lot at stake this is not an ordinary time and this is not an ordinary election we are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world from the supreme court to energy and so much else and so there is a lot at stake it\ one of the most consequential elections that we\ve had and that\ why i\ve tried to put forth specific policies and plans trying to get it off of the personal and put it on to what it is i want to do as president and that\ why i hope people will check on that for themselves so that they can see that yes i\ve spent 30 years actually maybe a little more working to help kids and families and i want to take all that experience to the white house and do that every single day
2,thank you very much chris and thanks to unlv for hosting us you know i think when we talk about the supreme court it really raises the central issue in this election namely what kind of country are we going to be what kind of opportunities will we provide for our citizens what kind of rights will americans have and i feel strongly that the supreme court needs to stand on the side of the american people not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy for me that means that we need a supreme court that will stand up on behalf of women\ rights on behalf of the rights of the lgbt community that will stand up and say no to citizens united a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark unaccountable money to come into our electoral system i have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the supreme court but i feel that at this point in our country\ history it is important that we not reverse marriage equality that we not reverse roe v wade that we stand up against citizens united we stand up for the rights of people in the workplace that we stand up and basically say the supreme court should represent all of us that\ how i see the court and the kind of people that i would be looking to nominate to the court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful standing up on behalf of our rights as americans and i look forward to having that opportunity i would hope that the senate would do its job and confirm the nominee that president obama has sent to them that\ the way the constitution fundamentally should operate the president nominates and then the senate advises and consents or not but they go forward with the process  well first of all i support the second amendment i lived in arkansas for 18 wonderful years i represented upstate new york i understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership it goes back to the founding of our country but i also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation because i support the second amendment doesn\t mean that i want people who shouldn\t have guns to be able to threaten you kill you or members of your family and so when i think about what we need to do we have 33000 people a year who die from guns i think we need comprehensive background checks need to close the online loophole close the gun show loophole there\ other matters that i think are sensible that are the kind of reforms that would make a difference that are not in any way conflicting with the second amendment you mentioned the heller decision and what i was saying that you referenced chris was that i disagreed with the way the court applied the second amendment in that case because what the district of columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them and the court didn\t accept that reasonable regulation but they\ve accepted many others so i see no conflict between saving people\ lives and defending the second amendment  well i was upset because unfortunately dozens of toddlers injure themselves even kill people with guns because unfortunately not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions but there\ no doubt that i respect the second amendment that i also believe there\ an individual right to bear arms that is not in conflict with sensible commonsense regulation and you know look i understand that donald\ been strongly supported by the nra the gun lobby\ on his side they\re running millions of dollars of ads against me and i regret that because what i would like to see is for people to come together and say of course we\re going to protect and defend the second amendment but we\re going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33000 lives that we lose every year  well i strongly support roe v wade which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate most difficult in many cases decisions about her health care that one can imagine and in this case it\ not only about roe v wade it is about what\ happening right now in america so many states are putting very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice to the extent that they are defunding planned parenthood which of course provides all kinds of cancer screenings and other benefits for women in our country donald has said he\ in favor of defunding planned parenthood he even supported shutting the government down to defund planned parenthood i will defend planned parenthood i will defend roe v wade and i will defend women\ rights to make their own health care decisions  and we have come too far to have that turned back now and indeed he said women should be punished that there should be some form of punishment for women who obtain abortions and i could just not be more opposed to that kind of thinking  because roe v wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account and when i voted as a senator i did not think that that was the case the kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking painful decisions for families to make i have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy i do not think the united states government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions so you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account  well that is not what happens in these cases and using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate you should meet with some of the women that i have met with women i have known over the course of my life this is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make and i do not believe the government should be making it you know i\ve had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country i\ve been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions like they used to do in china or forced women to bear children like they used to do in romania and i can tell you the government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith with medical advice and i will stand up for that right  well as he was talking i was thinking about a young girl i met here in las vegas carla who is very worried that her parents might be deported because she was born in this country but they were not they work hard they do everything they can to give her a good life and you\re right i don\t want to rip families apart i don\t want to be sending parents away from children i don\t want to see the deportation force that donald has talked about in action in our country we have 11 million undocumented people they have 4 million american citizen children 15 million people he said as recently as a few weeks ago in phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation now here\ what that means it means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence where law enforcement officers would be going school to school home to home business to business rounding up people who are undocumented and we would then have to put them on trains on buses to get them out of our country i think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation i think it\ an idea that would rip our country apart i have been for border security for years i voted for border security in the united states senate and my comprehensive immigration reform plan of course includes border security but i want to put our resources where i think they\re most needed getting rid of any violent person anybody who should be deported we should deport them when it comes to the wall that donald talks about building he went to mexico he had a meeting with the mexican president didn\t even raise it he choked and then got into a twitter war because the mexican president said we\re not paying for that wall so i think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly and that\ why i\m introducing comprehensive immigration reform within the first 100 days with the path to citizenship  i voted for border security and there are  there are some limited places where that was appropriate there also is necessarily going to be new technology and how best to deploy that but it is clear when you look at what donald has been proposing he started his campaign bashing immigrants calling mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and drug dealers that he has a very different view about what we should do to deal with immigrants now what i am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows putting them into the formal economy will be good because then employers can\t exploit them and undercut americans\ wages and donald knows a lot about this he used undocumented labor to build the trump tower he underpaid undocumented workers and when they complained he basically said what a lot of employers do you complain i\ll get you deported i want to get everybody out of the shadows get the economy working and not let employers like donald exploit undocumented workers which hurts them but also hurts american workers  we will not have open borders that is that is a rank mischaracterization we will have secure borders but we\ll also have reform and this used to be a bipartisan issue ronald reagan was the last president   to sign immigration reform and george w bush supported it as well  well if you went on to read the rest of the sentence i was talking about energy you know we trade more energy with our neighbors than we trade with the rest of the world combined and i do want us to have an electric grid an energy system that crosses borders i think that would be a great benefit to us but you are very clearly quoting from wikileaks and what\ really important about wikileaks is that the russian government has engaged in espionage against americans they have hacked american websites american accounts of private people of institutions then they have given that information to wikileaks for the purpose of putting it on the internet this has come from the highest levels of the russian government clearly from putin himself in an effort as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed to influence our election  so i actually think the most important question of this evening chris is finally will donald trump admit and condemn that the russians are doing this and make it clear that he will not have the help of putin in in this election that he rejects russian espionage against americans which he actually encouraged in the past those are the questions we need answered we\ve never had anything like this happen in any of our elections before  well that\ because he\d rather have a puppet as president of the united states  and it\ pretty clear it\ pretty clear you won\t admit  that the russians have engaged in cyberattacks against the united states of america that you encouraged espionage against our people that you are willing to spout the putin line sign up for his wish list break up nato do whatever he wants to do and that you continue to get help from him because he has a very clear favorite in this race so i think that this is such an unprecedented situation we\ve never had a foreign government trying to interfere in our election we have 17  17 intelligence agencies civilian and military who have all concluded that these espionage attacks these cyberattacks come from the highest levels of the kremlin and they are designed to influence our election i find that deeply disturbing  and i think it\ time you take a stand i am not quoting myself i am quoting 17  17 intelligence  do you doubt 17 military and civilian  agencies well he\d rather believe vladimir putin than the military and civilian intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect us i find that just absolutely i  i find it ironic that he\ raising nuclear weapons this is a person who has been very cavalier even casual about the use of nuclear weapons he\   advocated more countries getting them japan korea even saudi arabia he said well if we have them why don\t we use them which i think is terrifying but here\ the deal the bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order it must be followed there\ about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so and that\ why 10 people who have had that awesome responsibility have come out and in an unprecedented way said they would not trust donald trump with the nuclear codes or to have his finger on the nuclear button  well i\m just quoting you when you were asked   about a potential nuclear  nuclear competition in asia you said you know go ahead enjoy yourselves folks that kind   of language  well the united states has kept the peace  the united states has kept the peace through our alliances donald wants to tear up our alliances i think it makes the world safer and frankly it makes the united states safer i would work with our allies in asia in europe in the middle east and elsewhere that\ the only way we\re going to be able to keep the peace  well i think when the middle class thrives america thrives and so my plan is based on growing the economy giving middleclass families many more opportunities i want us to have the biggest jobs program since world war ii jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing i think we can compete with highwage countries and i believe we should new jobs and clean energy not only to fight climate change which is a serious problem but to create new opportunities and new businesses i want us to do more to help small business that\ where two thirds of the new jobs are going to come from i want us to raise the national minimum wage because people who live in poverty should not  who work fulltime should not still be in poverty and i sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do i feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college that\ why i want more technical education in high schools and in community colleges real apprenticeships to prepare young people for the jobs of the future i want to make college debtfree and for families making less than 125000 you will not get a tuition bill from a public college or university if the plan that i worked on with bernie sanders is enacted and we\re going to work hard to make sure that it is because we are going to go where the money is most of the gains in the last years since the great recession have gone to the very top so we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share we\re going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country that is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs by contrast donald\ plan has been analyzed to conclude it might lose 35 million jobs why because his whole plan is to cut taxes to give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations adding 20 trillion to our debt and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before because it truly will be trickledown economics on steroids so the plan i have i think will actually produce greater opportunities the plan he has will cost us jobs and possibly lead to another great recession  well let me translate that if i can chris because   the fact is he\ going to advocate for the largest tax cuts we\ve ever seen three times more than the tax cuts under the bush administration i have said repeatedly throughout this campaign i will not raise taxes on anyone making 250000 or less i also will not add a penny to the debt i have costed out what i\m going to do he will through his massive tax cuts add 20 trillion to the debt well he mentioned the debt we know how to get control of the debt when my husband was president we went from a 300 billion deficit to a 200 billion surplus and we were actually on the path to eliminating the national debt when president obama came into office he inherited the worst economic disaster since the great depression he has cut the deficit by twothirds so yes one of the ways you go after the debt one of the ways you create jobs is by investing in people so i do have investments investments in new jobs investments in education skill training and the opportunities for people to get ahead and stay ahead that\ the kind of approach that will work  cutting taxes on the wealthy we\ve tried that it has not worked the way that it has been promised  well it\ a combination chris and let me say that when you inherit the level of economic catastrophe that president obama inherited it was a real touchandgo situation i was in the senate before i became secretary of state i\ve never seen people as physically distraught as the bush administration team was because of what was happening to the economy i personally believe that the steps that president obama took saved the economy he doesn\t get the credit he deserves for taking some very hard positions but it was a terrible recession so now we\ve dug ourselves out of it we\re standing but we\re not yet running so what i am proposing is that we invest from the middle out and the ground up not the top down that is not going to work that\ why what i have put forward doesn\t add a penny to the debt but it is the kind of approach that will enable more people to take those new jobs higherpaying jobs we\re beginning to see some increase in incomes and we certainly have had a long string of increasing jobs we\ve got to do more to get the whole economy moving and that\ what i believe i will be able to do  well first let me say number one when i saw the final agreement for tpp i said i was against it it didn\t meet my test i\ve had the same test does it create jobs raise incomes and further our national security i\m against it now i\ll be against it after the election i\ll be against it when i\m president there\ only one of us on this stage who\ actually shipped jobs to mexico because that\ donald he\ shipped jobs to 12 countries including mexico but he mentioned china and you know one of the biggest problems we have with china is the illegal dumping of steel and aluminum into our markets i have fought against that as a senator i\ve stood up against it as secretary of state donald has bought chinese steel and aluminum in fact the trump hotel right here in las vegas was made with chinese steel so he goes around with crocodile tears about how terrible it is but he has given jobs to chinese steelworkers not american steelworkers  that\ the kind of approach that is just not going to work we\re going to pull the country together we\re going to have trade agreements that we enforce that\ why i\m going to have a trade prosecutor for the first time in history and we\re going to enforce those agreements and we\re going to look for businesses to help us by buying american products  no i voted  well first of all what he just said about the state department is not only untrue it\ been debunked numerous times  but i think it\ really an important issue he raised the 30 years of experience so let me just talk briefly about that you know back in the 1970s i worked for the children\ defense fund and i was taking on discrimination against africanamerican kids in schools he was getting sued by the justice department for racial discrimination in his apartment buildings in the 1980s i was working to reform the schools in arkansas he was borrowing 14 million from his father to start his businesses in the 1990s i went to beijing and i said women\ rights are human rights he insulted a former miss universe alicia machado called her an eating machine  and on the day when i was in the situation room monitoring the raid that brought osama bin laden to justice he was hosting the celebrity apprentice so i\m happy to compare my 30 years of experience what i\ve done for this country trying to help in every way i could especially kids and families get ahead and stay ahead with your 30 years and i\ll let the american people make that decision  well at the last debate we heard donald talking about what he did to women and after that a number of women have come forward saying that\ exactly what he did to them now what was his response well he held a number of big rallies where he said that he could not possibly have done those things to those women because they were not attractive enough for them to be assaulted  in fact he went on to say  he went on to say look at her i don\t think so about another woman he said that wouldn\t be my first choice he attacked the woman reporter writing the story called her disgusting as he has called a number of women during this campaign donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger he goes after their dignity their selfworth and i don\t think there is a woman anywhere who doesn\t know what that feels like so we now know what donald thinks and what he says and how he acts toward women that\ who donald is i think it\ really up to all of us to demonstrate who we are and who our country is and to stand up and be very clear about what we expect from our next president how we want to bring our country together where we don\t want to have the kind of pitting of people one against the other where instead we celebrate our diversity we lift people up and we make our country even greater america is great because america is good and it really is up to all of us to make that true now and in the future and particularly for our children and our grandchildren  well every time donald is pushed on something which is obviously uncomfortable like what these women are saying he immediately goes to denying responsibility and it\ not just about women he never apologizes or says he\ sorry for anything so we know what he has said and what he\ done to women but he also went after a disabled reporter mocked and mimicked him on national television  he went after mr and mrs khan the parents of a young man who died serving our country a gold star family because of their religion he went after john mccain a prisoner of war said he prefers people who aren\t captured he went after a federal judge born in indiana but who donald said couldn\t be trusted to try the fraud and racketeering case against trump university because his parents were mexican so it\ not one thing this is a pattern a pattern of divisiveness of a very dark and in many ways dangerous vision of our country where he incites violence where he applauds people who are pushing and pulling and punching at his rallies that is not who america is and i hope that as we move in the last weeks of this campaign more and more people will understand what\ at stake in this election it really does come down to what kind of country we are going to have  well everything i did as secretary of state was in furtherance of our country\ interests and our values the state department has said that i think that\ been proven but i am happy in fact i\m thrilled to talk about the clinton foundation because it is a worldrenowned charity and i am so proud of the work that it does you know i could talk for the rest of the debate  i know i don\t have the time to do that but just briefly the clinton foundation made it possible for 11 million people around the world with hivaids to afford treatment and that\ about half all the people in the world who are getting treatment in partnership with the american health association   we have made environments in schools healthier for kids including healthier lunches  well it is an open discussion and you  well but there is no  but there is no evidence  but there is there is a lot of evidence about the very good work  and the high rankings well very quickly we at the clinton foundation spend 90 percent  90 percent of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs of people around the world and in our own country i\m very proud of that we have the highest rating from the watchdogs that follow foundations and i\d be happy to compare what we do with the trump foundation which took money from other people and bought a six foot portrait of donald i mean who does that it just was astonishing but when it comes to haiti haiti is the poorest country in our hemisphere the earthquake and the hurricanes it has devastated haiti bill and i have been involved in trying to help haiti for many years the clinton foundation raised 30 million to help haiti after the catastrophic earthquake and all of the terrible problems the people there had we have done things to help small businesses agriculture and so much else and we\re going to keep working to help haiti   because it\ an important part of the american experience but of course there\ no way we can know whether any of that is true because he hasn\t released his tax returns he is the first candidate ever to run for president in the last 40plus years who has not released his tax returns so everything he says about charity or anything else we can\t prove it you can look at our tax returns we\ve got them all out there but what is really troubling is that we learned in the last debate he has not paid a penny in federal income tax and we were talking about immigrants a few minutes ago chris you know half of all immigrants  undocumented immigrants in our country  actually pay federal income tax so we have undocumented immigrants in america who are paying more federal income tax than a billionaire i find that just astonishing  well you know  made with chinese steel well chris let me respond to that because that\ horrifying you know every time donald thinks things are not going in his direction he claims whatever it is is rigged against him the fbi conducted a yearlong investigation into my emails they concluded there was no case he said the fbi was rigged he lost the iowa caucus he lost the wisconsin primary he said the republican primary was rigged against him then trump university gets sued for fraud and racketeering he claims the court system and the federal judge is rigged against him there was even a time when he didn\t get an emmy for his tv program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the emmys were rigged against him  this is  this is a mindset this is how donald thinks and it\ funny but it\ also really troubling  so that is not the way our democracy works we\ve been around for 240 years we\ve had free and fair elections we\ve accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them and that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a debate stage during a general election you know president obama said the other day when you\re whining before the game is even finished  it just shows you\re not up to doing the job and let\  you know let\ be clear about what he is saying and what that means he is denigrating  he\ talking down our democracy and i for one am appalled that somebody who is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind of position  well i am encouraged that there is an effort led by the iraqi army supported by kurdish forces and also given the help and advice from the number of special forces and other americans on the ground but i will not support putting american soldiers into iraq as an occupying force i don\t think that is in our interest and i don\t think that would be smart to do in fact chris i think that would be a big red flag waving for isis to reconstitute itself the goal here is to take back mosul it\ going to be a hard fight i\ve got no illusions about that and then continue to press into syria to begin to take back and move on raqqa which is the isis headquarters i am hopeful that the hard work that american military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a real  a really successful military operation but we know we\ve got lots of work to do syria will remain a hotbed of terrorism as long as the civil war aided and abetted by the iranians and the russians continue so i have said look we need to keep our eye on isis that\ why i want to have an intelligence surge that protects us here at home why we have to go after them from the air on the ground online why we have to make sure here at home we don\t let terrorists buy weapons if you\re too dangerous to fly you\re too dangerous to buy a gun and i\m going to continue to push for a nofly zone and safe havens within syria not only to help protect the syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees but to frankly gain some leverage on both the syrian government and the russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track  well you know once again donald is implying that he didn\t support the invasion of iraq i said it was a mistake i\ve said that years ago he has consistently denied what is   a very clear fact that  before the invasion he supported it and you know i just want everybody to go google it google donald trump iraq and you will see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of iraq  and you can actually hear the audio of him saying that now why does that matter well it matters because he has not told the truth about that position i guess he believes it makes him look better now to contrast with me because i did vote for it but what\ really important here is to understand all the interplay mosul is a sunni city mosul is on the border of syria and yes we do need to go after baghdadi and  just like we went after bin laden while you were doing celebrity apprentice and we brought him to justice we need to go after the leadership but we need to get rid of them get rid of their fighters there are an estimated several thousand fighters in mosul they\ve been digging underground they\ve been prepared to defend it\ going to be tough fighting but i think we can take back mosul and then we can move on into syria and take back raqqa this is what we have to do i\m just amazed that he seems to think that the iraqi government and our allies and everybody else launched the attack on mosul to help me in this election but that\ how donald thinks you know he always is looking for some conspiracy  he has all the conspiracy theories this conspiracy theory which he\ been spewing out for quite some time  he says  unfit and he proves it every time he talks  well you should ask bernie sanders who he\ supporting for president and he has said   as he has campaigned for me around the country you are the most dangerous person to run for president in the modern history of america i think he\ right  well chris first of all i think a nofly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict i\m well aware of the really legitimate concerns that you have expressed from both the president and the general this would not be done just on the first day this would take a lot of negotiation and it would also take making it clear to the russians and the syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground we\ve had millions of people leave syria and those millions of people inside syria who have been dislocated so i think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the russians and the syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interests of the people on the ground in syria it would help us with our fight against isis but i want to respond to what donald said about refugees he\ made these claims repeatedly i am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted who we do not have confidence in but i am not going to slam the door on women and children that picture of that little 4yearold boy in aleppo with the blood coming down his face while he sat in an ambulance is haunting and so we are going to do very careful thorough vetting that does not solve our internal challenges with isis and our need to stop radicalization to work with american muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks in fact the killer of the dozens of people at the nightclub in orlando the pulse nightclub was born in queens the same place donald was born so let\ be clear about what the threat is and how we are best going to be able to meet it and yes some of that threat emanates from over in syria and iraq and we\ve got to keep fighting and i will defeat isis and some of it is we have to up our game and be much smarter here at home  well first when i hear donald talk like that and know that his slogan is make america great again i wonder when he thought america was great and before he rushes and says you know before you and president obama were there i think it\ important to recognize that he has been criticizing our government for decades you know back in 1987 he took out a 100000 ad in the new york times during the time when president reagan was president and basically said exactly what he just said now that we were the laughingstock of the world he was criticizing president reagan this is the way donald thinks about himself puts himself into you know the middle and says you know i alone can fix it as he said on the convention stage but if you look at the debt which is the issue you asked about chris i pay for everything i\m proposing i do not add a penny to the national debt i take that very seriously because i do think it\ one of the issues we\ve got to come to grips with so when i talk about how we\re going to pay for education how we\re going to invest in infrastructure how we\re going to get the cost of prescription drugs down and a lot of the other issues that people talk to me about all the time i\ve made it very clear we are going where the money is we are going to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share and there is no evidence whatsoever that that will slow down or diminish our growth in fact i think just the opposite we\ll have what economists call middleout growth we\ve got to get back to rebuilding the middle class the families of america that\ where growth will come from that\ why i want to invest in you i want to invest in your family and i think that\ the smartest way to grow the economy to make the economy fairer and we just have a big disagreement about this it may be because of our experiences you know he started off with his dad as a millionaire  i started off with  my dad was a smallbusiness man and i think it  you know it\ a difference that affects how we see the world and what we want to do with the economy  well chris i am on record as saying that we need to put more money into the social security trust fund that\ part of my commitment to raise taxes on the wealthy my social security payroll contribution will go up as will donald\ assuming he can\t figure out how to get out of it but what we want to do is to replenish the social security trust fund   by making sure that we have sufficient resources and that will come from either raising the cap and/or finding other ways to get more money into it i will not cut benefits i want to enhance benefits for lowincome workers and for women who have been disadvantaged by the current social security system but what donald is proposing with these massive tax cuts will result in a 20 trillion additional national debt that will have dire consequences for social security and medicare and i\ll say something about the affordable care act which he wants to repeal the affordable care act extended the solvency of the medicare trust fund so if repeals it our medicare problem gets worse what we need to do is go after   the longterm health care drivers we\ve got to get costs down increase value emphasize wellness i have a plan for doing that and i think that we will be able to get entitlement spending under control by with more resources and harder decisions  well i would like to say to everyone watching tonight that i\m reaching out to all americans  democrats republicans and independents  because we need everybody to help make our country what it should be to grow the economy to make it fairer to make it work for everyone we need your talents your skills your commitments your energy your ambition you know i\ve been privileged to see the presidency up close and i know the awesome responsibility of protecting our country and the incredible opportunity of working to try to make life better for all of you i have made the cause of children and families really my life\ work that\ what my mission will be in the presidency i will stand up for families against powerful interests against corporations i will do everything that i can to make sure that you have good jobs with rising incomes that your kids have good educations from preschool through college i hope you will give me a chance to serve as your president
3,wow what a great way to begin and to all of you especially mary carmen and lakeisha thank you for speaking on behalf of providers and parents we\re going to hear from everybody as we go through our event today i want to thank everyone at new horizons for welcoming us to this facility and to all my friends at seiu as well\nwe\re here today to talk about childcare but its important to understand that when we talk about childcare we\re talking about the economy we\re talking about families we\re talking about fairness we\re talking about all of the values that we believe are necessary to raise healthy successful productive children in society today i want to say just a few words about what\ happening with our economy and more broadly about america\ families because i think when our families are strong america is strong and if we don\t have strong families its really hard for us to be the kind of strong nation that sets the table for our children to do better\n\nwe\ve come back from really tough economic times the great recession just really knocked people to the ground people lost their jobs they lost their homes they postponed doing things like going to college they had to keep working if they had a job even if they were at or beyond retirement it really took a lot out of everybody and we are in much better shape today in large measure because families made the sacrifice and worked really hard despite the odds they took extra jobs like some of you they skipped what were really necessities but they figured out how to make them not as urgent a need like not driving the car as much or not buying all the food that the family required so everybody made it work\n\nbut the deck is still stacked for those at the top something is wrong when top ceos earn 300 times more than what the average worker earns and i heard a statistic the other day that was kind of related to what we\re talking about today if you take the salaries the compensation of the top 25 hedge fund managers in america those 25 men make more than all the kindergarten teachers in the country put together now i happen to think that kindergarten teachers and child care providers and child development specialists are really important because they are the people that are helping to get our kids off to a good start working with families\n\nand i\m running for president because i think everyday americans need a champion a champion that gets up every single day and goes to work and goes to bat and does everything i can to help families just get by which is what you were talking about i want you to get ahead and stay ahead i want to make the words middle class mean something again\n\nnow when we think about strong families being the backbone of our country we have to recognize that our economy is different and our families are different i was born in chicago and the families of today are not exactly the same as the family i was born into most families need two incomes or two jobs if there is only one parent to make ends meet and 40 percent of moms just like lakeisha are now the sole or the primary breadwinners in their household so that\ a big different from the way it was when i and others here were growing up yet we haven\t adjusted our economy or our government programs to take those differences into account you know i can remember very well when i was a young lawyer before i had my daughter in my law firm where i worked in arkansas around 3 o\clock i\d see all the women who worked there sort of whispering into their phones and i didn\t know why but it was just like clockwork well they were trying to make sure their kids got home safely because their kids were walking home or getting off the bus and going home waiting for mom to get home and it wasn\t accepted back then that you could be a good worker and a devoted parent at the same time especially for women but that kind of juggling act is what most of us do all the time now and therefore we have to adjust how we support families so that you can be the best you can be and how we support small businesses like so many child care providers so you can make a living while you do what you love\n\nso we know that with moms and dads squeezing every minute out of a 24hour day and with you mary carmen saying you work 17 hours it\ hard to even find time to breathe and many can\t count on anybody being there to help you because everyone you know is working hard and trying to make ends meet\n\nso finding high quality affordable flexible childcare is more important than ever but it\ also harder than ever\n\nfederal and state funding for childcare has not kept up with changing times and rising demand so it\ no surprise that outofpocket childcare costs for families have soared by nearly 25 percent over the past decade and now the republican budget that is being worked on by the congress would cut funding even more making it so much more difficult america cannot turn its back on our children and our working parents family values are economic values i\m going to be putting forth plans to fix this we should do it now and republicans should either get on board or get out of the way\n\nbecause it\ now time for us to face reality our families need new solutions today they need real help not promises and i\m very clear about what i think needs to be done but i want to hear from all of you because what i\m doing in traveling around the country is taking ideas i have some of which i have been developing for many years but hearing from people on the front lines whether its immigration or small business or today child care\n\nfirst to bring down outofcontrol family costs we need to make investments in childcare a national priority\n\nwhat president obama has proposed is a good start i\ll look for responsible ways to go even further whether it\ providing tax cuts to new parents or grants to states targeted for infants and toddlers whatever its going to take to give both lakeisha and the providers more opportunities and you know its embarrassing i traveled to 112 countries as your secretary of state there are only 9 countries left in the world that have no form of paid family leave and we are one of them and the other ones are tiny countries countries without many resources every other country has something that says we think it\ really important that moms bond with their newborn babies we think its important that a dad can have some time we think it\ important that children can take care of their parents as those parents maybe are ill or failing so we\ve got to have better systems in place with more support and we have to focus on quality so that all our kids have access to the best possible care and many of you know how hard that is because you have two people helping you take care of 16 children there are a lot of places where there would be one person trying to take care of 16 children we have to reducing overcrowding and increasing training and most importantly we have to increase wages because you expect to make a living doing the most important job in the world if you have to sacrifice your own family that doesn\t make any sense to me at all\n\nso to all the childcare workers here today i want you to know that the service and care you provide strengthens our economy it strengthens families and helps prepare children you should be valued for that respected for that and you should be paid for that\n\nnow i am a new grandmother and it\ really wonderful but just being around my new 7 1/2 month old granddaughter just reinforces what i believe which is when when we shortchange childcare workers we shortchange kids and shortchange americans\ future it makes it harder to retain the best staff it makes it harder to keep up those high standards\n\nso we have to stand firmly together and united on behalf of your right to organize your right to bargain collectively your right to fighting together for the higher wages that reflect the value of your work there is nothing more important to the family or to the support of the family which you are than caring for our youngest children\n\nthat\ why i so respect the vital work that seiu is doing under the leadership of president mary kay henry is so vital i think it is absolutely essential\n\nand i want to say something else about it when people talk to me about the need to improve our educations system i agree because i want every child to have the best possible education but education starts at birth education starts when that little baby comes into the world in fact we now know because of brain research that about 80 of the brain is actually developed by the age of 3 and 4 if we don\t take care of our babies we are short changing them on their brain development and then when we get to kindergarten no matter how hard they try no matter how much their mom says do your best do your homework no matter how hard their teacher works they\re going to be at a disadvantage that\ wrong it isn\t right that a child like my grandchild will have all of these opportunities because we\re reading and we\re talking and we\re singing but we\re not working 17 hour days and we\re not trying to get by on 5100 after the expenses are paid so yea we\re going to make sure that charlotte has every chance in the world but i want every baby everyone your babies and every baby you take care of to have exactly the same chances\n\nultimately this is for me about how we work together to give every child the chance to live up to his or her godgiven potential you see it in their faces when they are put in your arms from the very first minute you want to keep that light in their eyes you want to make sure they have every opportunity to fulfill that godgiven potential and i\m here because i want to help you and the parents you serve unlock that potential when we unlock the full potential of every american we can unlock the full potential and prosperity of america\n\nso for me this is as important an as anything else that i\m going to talk about in my campaign for president thank you
4,thank you so much it is wonderful to be here and see so many friends i\ve spoken at a lot of aipac conferences in the past but this has to be one of the biggest yet and there are so many young people here thousands of college students from hundreds of campuses around the country i think we should all give them a hand for being here and beginning their commitment to this important cause\nyou will keep the usisrael relationship going strong you know as a senator from new york and secretary of state i\ve had the privilege of working closely with aipac members to strengthen and deepen america\ ties with israel now we may not have always agreed on every detail but we\ve always shared an unwavering unshakable commitment to our alliance and to israel\ future as a secure and democratic homeland for the jewish people\n\nand your support helped us expand security and intelligence cooperation develop the iron dome missile defense system build a global coalition to impose the toughest sanctions in the history on iran and so much more since my first visit to israel 35 years ago i\ve returned many times and made many friends i\ve worked with and learned from some of israel\ great leaders although i don\t think yitzhak rabin ever forgave me for banishing him to the white house balcony when he wanted to smoke\n\nnow i\m here as a candidate for president and i know that all of you understand what\ at stake in this election our next president will walk into the oval office next january and immediately face a world of both perils we must meet with strength and skill and opportunities we must seize and build on the next president will sit down at that desk and start making decisions that will affect both the lives and livelihoods of every american and the security of our friends around the world\n\nso we have to get this right as aipac members you understand that while the turmoil of the middle east presents enormous challenge and complexity walking away is not an option\n\ncandidates for president who think the united states can outsource middle east security to dictators or that america no longer has vital national interests at stake in this region are dangerously wrong it would be a serious mistake for the united states to abandon our responsibilities or cede the mantle of leadership for global peace and security to anyone else\n\nas we gather here three evolving threats iran\ continued aggression a rising tide of extremism across a wide ark of instability and the growing effort to delegitimize israel on the world stage are converging to make the usisrael alliance more indispensable than ever\n\nwe have to combat all these trends with even more intense security and diplomatic cooperation united states and israel must be closer than ever stronger than ever and more determined than ever to prevail against our common adversaries and to advance our shared values\n\nthis is especially true at a time when israel faces brutal terrorist stabbings shootings and vehicle attacks at home parents worry about letting their children walk down the street families live in fear just a few weeks ago a young american veteran and west point graduate named taylor force was murdered by a palestinian terrorist near the jaffa port these attacks must end immediately and palestinian leaders need to stop inciting violence stop celebrating terrorists as martyrs and stop paying rewards to their families\n\nbecause we understand the threats israel faces we know we can never take for granted the strength of our alliance or the success of our efforts today americans and israelis face momentous choices that will shape the future of our relationship and of both our nations the first choice is this are we prepared to take the usisrael alliance to the next level this relationship has always been stronger and deeper than the headlines might lead you to believe our work together to develop the iron dome saved many israeli lives when hamas rockets began to fly\n\ni saw its effectiveness firsthand in 2012 when i worked with prime minister netanyahu to negotiate a seize fire in gaza and if i\m fortunate enough to be elected president the united states will reaffirm we have a strong and enduring national interest in israel\ security and we will never allow israel\ adversaries to think a wedge can be driven between us\n\nwhen we have differences as any friends do we will work to resolve them quickly and respectfully we will also be clear that the united states has an enduring interest in and commitment to a more peaceful more stable more secure middle east and we will step up our efforts to achieve that outcome indeed at a time of unprecedented chaos and conflict in the region america needs an israel strong enough to deter and defend against its enemies strong enough to work with us to tackle shared challenges and strong enough to take bold steps in the pursuit of peace\n\nthat\ why i believe we must take our alliance to the next level i hope a new 10year defense memorandum of understanding is concluded as soon as possible to meet israel\ security needs far into the future that will also send a clear message to israel\ enemies that the united states and israel stand together united it\ also why as president i will make a firm commitment to ensure israel maintains its qualitative military edge\n\nthe united states should provide israel with the most sophisticated defense technology so it can deter and stop any threat that includes bolstering israeli missile defenses with new systems like the arrow 3 and david\ sling and we should work together to develop better tunnel detection technology to prevent arms smuggling kidnapping and terrorist attacks\n\none of the first things i\ll do in office is invite the israeli prime minister to visit the white house and i will send a delegation from the pentagon and the joint chiefs to israel forearly consultations let\ also expand our collaboration beyond security together we can build an even more vibrant culture of innovation that tightens the links between silicon valley and israeli tech companies and entrepreneurs\n\nthere is much americans can learn from israel from cybersecurity to energy security to water security and just on an everyday people to people level and it\ especially important to continue fostering relationships between american and israeli young people who may not always remember our shared past they are the future of our relationship and we have to do more to promote that many of the young people here today are on the front lines of the battle to oppose the alarming boycott divestment and sanctions movement known as bds\n\nparticularly at a time when antisemitism is on the rise across the world especially in europe we must repudiate all efforts to malign isolate and undermine israel and the jewish people\n\ni\ve been sounding the alarm for a while now as i wrote last year to the heads of major americanjewish organizations we have to be united in fighting back against bds many of its proponents have demonized israeli scientists and intellectuals even students to all the college students who may have encountered this on campus i hope you stay strong keep speaking out don\t let anyone silence you bully you or try to shut down debate especially in places of learning like colleges and universities\n\nantisemitism has no place in any civilized society not in america not in europe not anywhere\n\nnow all of this work defending israel\ legitimacy expanding security and economic ties taking our alliance to the next level depends on electing a president with a deep personal commitment to israel\ future as a secure democratic jewish state and to america\ responsibilities as a global leader tonight you\ll hear from candidates with very different visions of american leadership in the region and around the world you\ll get a glimpse of a potential us foreign policy that would insult our allies not engage them and embolden our adversaries not defeat them\n\nfor the security of israel and the world we need america to remain a respected global leader committed to defending and advancing the international order an america able to block efforts to isolate or attack israel the alternative is unthinkable\n\nyes we need steady hands not a president who says he\ neutral on monday proisrael on tuesday and who knows what on wednesday because everything\ negotiable well my friends israel\ security is nonnegotiable\n\ni have sat in israeli hospital rooms holding the hands of men and women whose bodies and lives were torn apart by terrorist bombs i\ve listened to doctors describe the shrapnel left in a leg an arm or even a head that\ why i feel so strongly that america can\t ever be neutral when it comes to israel\ security or survival we can\t be neutral when rockets rain down on residential neighborhoods when civilians are stabbed in the street when suicide bombers target the innocent some things aren\t negotiable and anyone who doesn\t understand that has no business being our president\n\nthe second choice we face is whether we will have the strength and commitment to confront the adversaries that threaten us especially iran for many years we\ve all been rightly focused on the existential danger of iran acquiring a nuclear weapon after all this remains an extremist regime that threatens to annihilate israel\n\nthat\ why i led the diplomacy to impose crippling sanctions and force iran to the negotiating table and why i ultimately supported the agreement that has put a lid on its nuclear program today iran\ enriched uranium is all but gone thousands of centrifuges have stopped spinning iran\ potential breakout time has increased and new verification measures are in place to help us deter and detect any cheating\n\ni really believe the united states israel and the world are safer as a result but still as i laid out in a speech at the brookings institution last year it\ not good enough to trust and verify our approach must be distrust and verify\n\nthis deal must come with vigorous enforcement strong monitoring clear consequences for any violations and a broader strategy to confront iran\ aggression across the region we cannot forget that tehran\ fingerprints are on every conflict across the middle east from syria to lebanon to yemen the iranian revolutionary guard corps and its proxies are attempting to establish a position on the golan from which to threaten israel and they continue to fund palestinian terrorists\n\nin lebanon hezbollah is amassing an arsenal of increasingly sophisticated rockets and artillery that well may be able to hit every city in israel tonight you will hear a lot of rhetoric from the other candidates about iran but there\ a big difference between talking about holding tehran accountable and actually doing it our next president has to be able to hold together our global coalition and impose real consequences for even the smallest violations of this agreement\n\nwe must maintain the legal and diplomatic architecture to turn all the sanctions back on if needed if i\m elected the leaders of iran will have no doubt that if we see any indication that they are violating their commitments not to seek develop or acquire nuclear weapons the united states will act to stop it and that we will do so with force if necessary\n\niranian provocations like the recent ballistic missile tests also are unacceptable and should be answered firmly and quickly including with more sanctions\n\nthose missiles were stamped with words declaring and i quote israel should be wiped from the pages of history we know they could reach israel or hit the tens of thousands of american troops stationed in the middle east this is a serious danger and it demands a serious response\n\nthe united states must also continue to enforce existing sanctions and impose additional sanctions as needed on iran and the revolutionary guard for their sponsorship of terrorism illegal arms transfers human rights violations and other illicit behaviors like cyberattacks we should continue to demand the safe return of robert levinson and all american citizens unjustly held in iranian prisons\n\nand we must work closely with israel and other partners to cut off the flow of money and arms from iran to hezbollah if the arab league can designate all of hezbollah as a terrorist organization surely it is time for our friends in europe and the rest of the international community to do so as well and to do that now\n\nat the same time america should always stand with those voices inside iran calling for more openness now look we know the supreme leader still calls the shots and that the hardliners are intent on keeping their grip on power but the iranian people themselves deserve a better future and they are trying to make their voices heard they should know that america is not their\n\nenemy they should know we will support their efforts to bring positive change to iran\n\nnow of course iran is not the only threat we and israel face the united states and israel also have to stand together against the threat from isis and other radical jihadists an isis affiliate in the sinai is reportedly stepping up attempts to make inroads in gaza and partners with hamas\n\non saturday a number of israelis and other foreigners were injured or killed in a bombing in istanbul that may well be linked to isis two of the dead are usisraeli dual nationals this is a threat that knows no borders that\ why i\ve laid out a plan to take the fight to isis from the air on the ground with local forces and online where they recruit and inspire our goal cannot be to contain isis we must defeat isis\n\nand here is a third choice will we keep working toward a negotiated peace or lose forever the goal of two states for two peoples despite many setbacks i remain convinced that peace with security is possible and that it is the only way to guarantee israel\ longterm survival as a strong jewish and democratic state\n\nit may be difficult to imagine progress in this current climate when many israelis doubt that a willing and capable partner for peace even exists but inaction cannot be an option israelis deserve a secure homeland for the jewish people palestinians should be able to govern themselves in their own state in peace and dignity and only a negotiated twostate agreement can provide those outcomes\n\nif we look at the broader regional context converging interests between israel and key arab states could make it possible to promote progress on the israelipalestinian issue israelis and palestinians could contribute to our greater cooperation between israel and arabs i know how hard all of this is i remember what it took just to convene prime minister netanyahu and president abbas for the three sessions of direct facetoface peace talks in 2010 that i presided over but israelis and palestinians cannot give up on the hope of peace\n\nthat will only make it harder later all of us need to look for opportunities to create the conditions for progress including by taking positive actions that can rebuild trust like the recent constructive meetings between the israeli and palestinian finance ministers aiming to help bolster the palestinian economy or the daily ontheground security cooperation between israel and the palestinian authority\n\nbut at the same time all of us must condemn actions that setback the cause of peace terrorism should never be encouraged or celebrated and children should not be taught to hate in schools\n\nthat poisons the future everyone has to do their part by avoiding damaging actions including with respect to settlements now america has an important role to play in supporting peace efforts and as president i would continue the pursuit of direct negotiations and let me be clear i would vigorously oppose any attempt by outside parties to impose a solution including by the un security council\n\nthere is one more choice that we face together and in some ways it may be the most important of all will we as americans and as israelis stay true to the shared democratic values that have always been at the heart of our relationship we are both nations built by immigrants and exiles seeking to live and worship in freedom nations built on principles of equality tolerance and pluralism\n\nat our best both israel and america are seen as a light unto the nations because of those values this is the real foundation of our alliance and i think it\ why so many americans feel such a deep emotional connection with israel i know that i do and it\ why we cannot be neutral about israel and israel\ future because in israel\ story we see our own and the story of all people who struggle for freedom and selfdetermination\n\nthere\ so many examples you know we look at the pride parade in tel aviv one of the biggest and most prominent in the world and we marvel that such a bastion of liberty exists in a region so plagued by intolerance we see the vigorous even raucous debate in israeli politics and feel right at home\n\nand of course some of us remember a woman golda meir leading israel\ government decades ago and wonder what\ taking us so long here in america\n\nbut we cannot rest on what previous generations have accomplished every generation has to renew our values and yes even fight for them today americans and israelis face currents of intolerance and extremism that threaten the moral foundations of our societies now in a democracy we\re going to have differences but what americans are hearing on the campaign trail this year is something else entirely encouraging violence playing coy with white supremacists calling for 12 million immigrants to be rounded up and deported demanding we turn away refugees because of their religion and proposing a ban on all muslims entering the united states\n\nnow we\ve had dark chapters in our history before we remember the nearly 1000 jews aboard the st louis who were refused entry in 1939 and sent back to europe but america should be better than this and i believe it\ our responsibility as citizens to say so if you see bigotry oppose it if you see violence condemn it if you see a bully stand up to him\n\non wednesday evening jews around the world will celebrate the festival of purim and children will learn the story of esther who refused to stay silent in the face of evil it wasn\t easy she had a good life and by speaking out she risked everything but as mordecai reminded her we all have an obligation to do our part when danger gathers and those of us with power or influence have a special responsibility to do what\ right\n\nas elie wiesel said when accepting the nobel peace prize neutrality helps the oppressor never the victim silence encourages the tormentor never the tormented so my friends let us never be neutral or silent in the face of bigotry together let\ defend the shared values that already make america and israel great\n\nlet us do the hard work necessary to keep building our friendship and reach out to the next generation of americans and israelis so the bonds between our nations grow even deeper and stronger we are stronger together and if we face the future side by side i know for both israel and america our best days are still ahead\n\nthank you so much
5,hello\n\n\n\nthank you very much\n\n\n\nit feels great i\ve had just an amazing time we landed in the middle of the night from iowa still pretty pumped up about winning there and then got to work the next day and i\m seeing a lot of old friends meeting a lot of new people i have an uphill climb and i\m going to climb as high and hard as i can because i want to make my case for the people of new hampshire as you said they\re people that i feel very close to they\ve been good to my husband to me my family but what\ most important is the first in the nation primary it truly is a great opportunity to get out there explain what you want to do as president present your ideas and get vetted by the people of new hampshire\n\n\nyou know i don\t know i\n\ncooper does it bring out something in you\n\nwell the intensity of the experience and the importance of trying to convey what\ at stake in this election because to me obviously tuesday is a really big deal with the primary but the goal has to be to prevent the republicans from getting back into the white house and undoing all the progress that has been made under president obama\n\nand so i\m very proud of the campaign that senator sanders and i are running i mean we really have focused on issues we share a lot of the same big progressive goals but we have different ways of going about them we bring different experiences but we are contrasting on issues compared to the republicans who i think are contrasting on insults and i think it\ a better contest where we can take our ideas to groups like this throughout new hampshire get questions have people vet them and then let the voters make up their minds\n\n\nwell you know you asked me this question in the first debate right\n\n\n\nand i said that i\m a progressive who likes to get things done and i was somewhat amused today that senator sanders has set himself up to be the gatekeeper on who is the progressive because under the definition that was flying around on twitter and statements by the campaign barack obama would not be a progressive joe biden would not be a progressive jeanne shaheen would not be a progressive even the late great senator paul wellstone would not be a progressive so i\m not going to let that bother me i know where i stand i know who stands with me i know what i\ve done but i don\t think it helps for the senator to be making those kinds of comparisons because clearly we all share a lot of the same hopes and aspirations for our country that we want to see achieved and i don\t think it\ appropriate that you know if planned parenthood endorses me or the human rights campaign endorses me you know they\re thrown out of the progressive wing and put into the establishment that\ just not anything we need to do let\ have a good contest of ideas let\ contrast where we stand and that\ what i intend to do for the next couple of days\n\n\n\nyou think so \n\nthat\ amazing yes look you know i was very fortunate to have a great team of young people men and women supporting me but i accept the fact that i have work to do to convey what i stand for what i\ve accomplished what i want to do for young people in our country\n\nbut i  well you know i don\t really know anderson i think  here\ what i want young people to know they don\t have to be for me i\m going to be for them it doesn\t really matter\n\nif they are not supporting me i will be their president i will do everything i can to give them the opportunities they deserve\n\nas i speak with young people across the country in iowa new hampshire and elsewhere i do sense this real feeling of being somehow disadvantaged put on the wrong side of american opportunity and i understand that i mean the student debt problems the feeling that the jobs that are out there are not producing the kind of income or opportunity that young people believe they should be able to get but at the same time i\m so impressed by the level the intensity of commitment of this generation to you know really going after discrimination going after racism and sexism and the kind of abuses that lgbt community members have looking for ways to bring more justice in the economy and the environment fighting climate change so i\m impressed with them and i\m going to do everything i can to reach out and to explain why good ideas on paper are important but you\ve got to be able to translate them into action to get results for people i have a lot experience doing that i think i can deliver positive change for young people in our country and i hope to have the chance to win their support\n\n\nwell that\ for sen sanders to explain because that certainly is the core of his message to young people i have a different take on it i think the progress that we have made and particularly the democratic party has made has been hard fought for hard won and must be defended so i want to defend the affordable care act it is one of the great accomplishments not only of this president but of the democratic party going back to harry truman the republicans are you know the republicans are determined to repeal it and they tried 62 times just to turn it back to the insurance companies sen sanders and i share the same goal we want to get to universal health care coverage before it was called obamacare it was called hillarycare as you remember\n\ni fought really hard the insurance companies and the drug companies spent millions against me i know what it\ like to go up against the status quo and special interests so when president obama succeeded i was thrilled i don\t agree with sen sanders that we should start over that we should throw our country into a contentious national debate about health care again we\re at 90 percent coverage i\m going to fix what needs to be fixed we\re going to move from 90 to 100 which is a lot easier to get to than starting at zero to get to 100 so we have a difference and i think that  is the difference\n\n\n\nsure\n\n\n\nhi david\n\n\n\nright\n\n\n\nwell i\ll tell you what dave i do have a litmus test i have a bunch of litmus tests because i agree with you the next president could get as many as three appointments you know one of the many reasons why we can\t turn the white house over to the republicans again is because of the supreme court i\m looking for people who understand the way the real world works who don\t have a kneejerk reaction to support business to support the idea that you know money is speech that gutted the voting rights act i voted for the reauthorization of the voting rights act when i was in the senate it passed 98 to nothing based on a very extensive set of hearings and research supreme court comes along they substitute their judgment for the congress signed by george w bush that is one of our problems they have a view that i just fundamentally disagree with about what the way we have to keep the balance of power in our society is so they have given way too much power to corporations they have given citizens united the biggest gift to the koch brothers karl rove and all of those folks whose values i don\t share and who are doing everything they can to try to turn the clock back we have to preserve marriage equality we have to go further to end discrimination against the lgbt community we\ve got to make sure we\ve got to make sure to preserve roe v wade not let it be nibbled away or repealed\n\nwe\ve got work to do and here\ how i think about it because when i was a senator i had to vote on supreme court justices i\m looking for people who are rooted in the real world who know that part of the genius of our system both economic and government is this balance of power if it gets too far out of whack so that business has too much power any branch of the government has too much power the delicate balance that makes up our political system and the broadbased prosperity we should be working for in our economy is the worse off for it so i have very strong feelings about what i\ll be looking for if i am given the honor of appointing somebody to the supreme court\n\n\n\n\n\nthank you\n\n\n\nwell first of all thank you for being here thank you so much for being part of this great new hampshire primary process and thank you for support and i really appreciate your asking the question and i have to tell you this is the first time i\ve been asked that question\n\n\nyes i really i really\n\nkinhan maybe any candidate\n\nand i thank you for it because we need to have a conversation in our country there are states as you know\n\nkinhan yes\n\n that are moving to open up the opportunity without criminal liability for people to make this decision in consultation by their families even in some cases with medical professionals but the issue is whether the medical professionals want to be involved or just be counselors so it is a crucial issue that people deserve to understand from their own ethical religious faithbased perspective so here\ how i think about it i want  i want as president to try to catalyze that debate because i  i believe you\re right this is going to become an issue more and more\n\n\n\n often we are on the good side having many people live longer but often then with very serious illnesses that they can be sustained on but at some point don\t want to continue with the challenges that poses so i don\t have any easy or glib answer for you i think i would want to really immerse myself in the  the  the ethical writings the health writings the scientific writings the religious writings i know some other countries the netherlands and others have a quite open approach i\d like to know what their experience has been because we  we have to be sure that nobody is coerced nobody is under duress and that is a difficult line to draw so i thank you  i thank you so much for raising this really important absolutely critical question that we\re all going to have to do some thinking about\n\n\n\nhi michael\n\n\n\nno i can\t michael i mean i  i\d like to be able to say i could but here\ what i can say i have learned and have been you know really in the crucible of making a lot of hard decisions over the last years and military force must always be a last resort not a first choice that is one of the biggest differences between me and the republicans\n\ni worked very hard as secretary of state to do what i could diplomatically to avoid conflict that\ why i worked to get the coalition together to impose sanctions in iran so that we could get them to the negotiating table in order to test whether we could get an agreement to put a nuclear weapons agreement in place i did that in large measure motivated by my deep concern that the absence of effective diplomacy might very well have sparked an arms race among some very unstable nations in the region and maybe even led to conflict i will do everything i possibly can to avoid sending american troops abroad getting us involved in military conflicts but i can\t in good conscious stand here and tell you that there would never be any circumstances in the time that i served as president where it very well might be in america\ best vital national security interest so i want to be honest with you i will do what i can i will stand against adventurism ill thought out missions i will not send american combat troops to iraq or syria that is off the table that would be a terrible mistake we will continue to use special forces and we have to because of the kinds of threats we face you know the network of terrorist organizations  not just isis but others who are part of this unfortunate network that stretches from north africa to south asia  pose serious threats to friends allies and partners as well as to ourselves and we\ve got to keep our country safe and we have to work with the rest of the world to try to defeat isis to end that terrorist threat so i will be a very careful deliberate decision maker when facing hard choices because i know what\ at stake and i know you can understand why there can\t be from me anyway a blanket statement but i want to assure you i will be transparent i will be open and i will explain to the american people if any occasion arises where we do have to take military action to protect ourselves or our close friends and partners\n\n\nyou know the first time i heard that yesterday and here\ the reasoning as best i i understand from listening to the testimony excerpts that if we\re going to open combat positions to qualified women so that they can compete to be army rangers they can compete to be navy seals they can compete to be infantry officers in the marines then we have expanded the definition of the allvolunteer military i i have to think about whether i think it\ necessary to go as far as our military officers are recommending you know from my perspective the allvolunteer military has worked and we should not do anything that undermines it because it has provided a solid core of people who are willing to serve our country the idea of having everybody register concerns me a little bit unless we have a better idea of where that\ going to come out where i want people to register i want every young person to register at the age of 18 to be able to vote automatically and i think if  if we had you know if we had a system like that i would i would be very very pleased about it i have a hard time imagining the kind of national emergency that would require the use of the selective service system so i just have to be better informed about why they\re making this recommendation\n\nhi rebecca\n\n\noh i think that\ a very fair question you know i did make a mistake and i admitted that i made a mistake and in large measure that mistake really arose from the bush administration\ approach to what they thought they could accomplish in iraq the very explicit appeal that president bush made before announcing the invasion that getting that vote would be a strong piece of leverage in order to finish the inspections and he made that comment and the un inspector hans blix said give us the time we will find out give us the hammer over their head namely the vote and we will be able to find out what they still have in terms of wmd and the bush administration didn\t give them the time and that was a breach of faith in my view but you know i gave them the vote in large measure because i thought that would give us the time and we would find out short of invasion turned out not to be and i really regret that that\ the way president bush proceeded that would not be something you would have to worry about with me if i tell you we\re going to do diplomacy we\re going to hang tough we\re going to get answers that\ exactly what we will do\n\n\nhi sean\n\n\nwell sean i had a lot of practice laughter and applause so i could laugh up here but it\ not easy it is a brutal experience and when it first started happening to me back in the early 1990s when i was working on health care and you know i was just unrecognizable to myself what talk radio was saying what republican members of congress and their allies were saying i was just stunned i could not understand how they got away with it and i have had to learn to take criticism seriously but not personally and by that i mean this the very fair question from rebecca people ask you questions or criticize you think about it seriously there are lessons to be learned often from people who don\t agree with you but don\t take it personally so that it just paralyzes you literally stops you in your tracks and so now that i\ve been through this for so many years sean my understanding of the political tactics that the other side uses is pretty well versed they play to keep they play to destroy they are constantly doing whatever they can to win and they have a history now going back you know 3536 years of going after people who they believe they can\t otherwise stop unless they engage in that negative attack so right now for example a couple of hedge fund billionaires have started a super pac to run ads against me karl rove has you know solicited money from wall street to run ads against me i view that as perversely flattering because clearly they know i mean what i say and i will do what i say and i will stand in their way and i will stop them from perpetuating an agenda on america that is bad for our democracy bad for our economy bad for our societies so i know i have to keep defending against them but i\m the one who has the experience to do that it\ unlike anything you\ve ever gone through to be the subject of tens of millions of dollars of untrue terrible attacks and now the koch brothers say they\re going to spend 750 million to defeat the democratic nominee i\m still standing and i will be standing so don\t worry about that\n\n\n\nright\n\n\n\ndon\t you \n\n\n\nyes it\ gotten even better funded you know they brought in some new multibillionaires to pump the money in\n\nand look these guys play for keeps they want to control our country senator sanders and i agree on that completely they want to rig the economy so they continue to get richer and richer they could care less about income inequality they salve their consciences by giving big money to philanthropy and you know getting great pictures of them standing in front of whatever charity they donated to but make no mistake they want to destroy unions they want to go after any economic interests that they don\t believe they can control they want to destroy our balance of power they want to go after our political system and fill it with people who will do their bidding i said today in dover you know i don\t think all of the republican candidates are so illinformed about climate change that they say they don\t know because they\re not scientists they\re just doing the bidding of the koch brothers they\re told don\t you dare say climate change is real because we\re in the fossil fuel business so this is exactly what they are up to and yes  it is probably  look at this point it\ probably not correct to say it\ a conspiracy because it\ out in the open you know there is no doubt about what they\re doing and who the players are and what they\re trying to achieve and they\re shopping among the republican candidates to figure out who among them will most likely do their bidding so just know what we\re up against because it\ real and we\re going to beat it but it\ going to take everybody working together\n\n\nhi alison\n\n\nthank you\n\n\n\nwell thank you for starting by saying it\ related to what i just said and i acknowledge this as personally painful as it is when you have been subjected to the level the velocity of attacks that come every day even if there is no factual basis to it it\ just normal for people to say gosh there has got to be something why do they keep saying this and then we do that and you know i testify for 11 hours there\ nothing to benghazi they don\t give it up they keep coming after it so i know that i have to really demonstrate as clearly as i can who i am what i stand for and what i\ve always done i\ve always been guided by the same values i have always listened to people and i\ve always worked as hard as i could to produce results for people so when i ran for the senate the first time and i was out there and you know people were barraging i was running first against rudy giuliani and all of that and i was able to just keep going and tell people here\ who i am here\ what i do i want to do this with you and i won and then since years later when i ran i got a higher percentage and then i did have as you all remember a really tough campaign against thensenator obama we saw each other very up close and personal and he wins and turns and asks me to be his secretary of state because he trusts me he trusts my judgment he trusts my experience so all i can do is to just get up every day and work to do what i believe our country needs find ways to help people whether it\ on mental health or addiction or autism or student loans whatever it might be and i trust the american people i trust the people of new hampshire to see my lifetime of work and service and to sort out all of the static and to know that i will work my heart out for you and that\ what i hope you will understand\n\n\n\nhello rabbi\n\n\nanother absolutely wonderful question thank you rabbi i think about this a lot um i feel very fortunate that i am a person of faith that i was raised in my church and that i have had to deal and struggle with a lot of these issues about ambition and humility about service and selfgratification all of the human questions that all of us deal with but when you put yourself out into the public arena i think it\ incumbent upon you to be as self conscious as possible this is hard for me you know i never thought i\d be standing on a stage here asking people to vote for me for president i always wanted to be of service i met my husband who was such a natural knew exactly what he wanted to do i was happy to support him while i worked in the children\ defense fund and legal services and taught law and you know had our daughter i never thought i would do this and so i have had to come to grips with how much more difficult it often is for me to talk about myself than to talk about what i want to do for other people or to tell stories about you know the man i met in rochester who  whose aids medicine is no longer affordable and that  that can grip me and make me feel like there\ something i can do about that so i\m constantly trying to balance how do i assume the mantle of a position as essentially august as president of the united states not lose track of who i am what i believe in and what i want to do to serve i have that dialogue at least you know once a day in some setting or another and i don\t know that there is any ever absolute answer like ok universe here i am watch me roar or oh my gosh i can\t do it it\ just overwhelming i have to retreat it\ that balance that i keep to try to find in my life that i want to see back in our country and it will be something that i continue to talk about with a  you know with a group of faith advisers who are close to me i get a scripture lesson every morning from a minister that i have a really close personal relationship with and you know it just gets me grounded he gets up really early to send it to me so you know there it is in my in box at 500 am i have friends who are rabbis who send me notes give me readings that are going to be discussed in services so i really appreciate all that incoming and the final thing i would say because again it\ not anything i\ve ever talked about this much publicly everybody knows i  i have lived a very public life for the last 25 or so years and so i\ve had to be in public dealing with some very difficult issues and personal issues political public issues and i read a um a treatment of the prodigal son parable by the jesuit henri nouwen who i think is a magnificent writer of spiritual and theological concerns and i  i read that parable and there was a line in it that became just a lifeline for me and it basically is practice the discipline of gratitude so regardless of how hard the days are how difficult the decisions are be grateful be grateful for being a human being being part of the universe be grateful for your limitations know that you have to reach out to have more people be with you to support you to advise you listen to your critics answer the questions but at the end be grateful practice the discipline of gratitude and that has helped me enormously\n\n\nok\n\n\nok\n\n\n\nwell look that\ just not the case and i did represent new york obviously\n\nthere was no doubt that i took on a lot of what was going down on wall street including calling them out on the mortgage issues calling for a consumer financial protection bureau even before we got one created calling for changes in ceo pay but i honestly think that the best answer to this is the fact that everybody that i know who looks at what\ happening in this campaign sees the same thing the wall street interests the money interests the republican political interests are spending a lot of money to try to defeat me so i just find it kind of a strange argument i happen to agree with sen sanders i\m not just going after wall street though i think that\ too narrow a target i think we need to go after a company like johnson controls that is trying to avoid paying taxes after all of us bailed it out by pretending to sell itself in a socalled inversion in europe it\ a perversion it should be stopped i want to go after the hedge funds that have bought up drug companies you know valeant pharmaceuticals turing pharmaceuticals taking drugs that have been around a long time and upping the price so i take seriously the obligation that i would have as president once again to try to get the deck unstacked to get the odds favoring the average american again and but i just have to  i have to respectfully say i think sen sanders\ target is too small i really do you know i respect him going after the big banks i agree with him no bank is too big to fail no executive to powerful to jail but we actually passed the process to be able to take on banks that pose excessive risk in our financial system in doddfrank so let\ know the next president has to implement but doesn\t have to achieve that here\ what i want to do i want to go after all the other culprits it wasn\t just the big banks it was the insurance company aig it was the investment bank lehman brothers it was countrywide mortgage it was wachovia there were a lot of bad actors and if all you do is look over here i\m telling you they\re going to be over there in the shadow banking sector just cooking up all kinds of ways to once again put our economy at risk so i\ve got no argument that we need to take on these vested interests i just have a wider group that i think we need to go after from pharmaceuticals  insurance companies shadow banking and other corporations that i think are undermining our ecoomy and frankly they are undermining our democracy this johnson controls thing really infuriates me we bailed them out the republicans wanted the auto industry to just fail they didn\t care about the millions of jobs barack obama and the democratic congress gave them a bailout it turned out to be a good deal all of us paid for it they paid back the treasury so we didn\t lose any money and we saved millions of jobs and the auto industry just had a great year johnson controls was one of those begging for the bailout and now they\re not going to pay their taxes we\re going to go right after that that is absolutely wrong and we need to be focused on getting a fix for that\n\n\n\nlook i made speeches to lots of groups i told them what i thought i answered questions\n\n\n\nwell i don\t know that\ what they offered so you know every secretary of state that i know has done that\n\n\n\nwell i didn\t know\n\n\n\nto be honest i wasn\t  i wasn\t committed to running i didn\t know whether i would or not\n\n\n\ni didn\t you know when i was secretary of state several times i said you know i think i\m done and you know so many people came to me started talking to me the circumstances the concerns i had about the republicans taking back the white house because i think they wrecked what we achieved in the 1990s with 23 million new jobs and incomes going up for everybody i did not want to see that happen again i want to defend president obama\ accomplishments and the progress we\ve made i want to go further so yes i was convinced but you know anybody who knows me who thinks that they can influence me name anything they\ve influenced me on just name one thing i\m out here every day saying i\m going to shut them down i\m going after them i\m going to jail them if they should be jailed i\m going to break them up i mean they\re not giving me very much money now i can tell you that much  fine with me\n\ni\m proud to have 90 percent of my donations from small donors and 60 percent the highest ever from women which i\m really really glad about\n\n\nno i don\t because you know i don\t feel that i paid any price for it and i am very clear about what i will do and they\re on notice\n\n\nhi chris\n\ni will do a lot chris because we have an opportunity to do much more with respect to research into marijuana what it can do to help people with the kinds of conditions you\ve just briefly described i want to move it from a schedule i drug to a schedule ii so that we can begin to do more research the nih and a lot of universities can begin to try to find out because i want you to know what we know from science but i also want you to be able to use it while we\re doing the research and so many states as you know have moved to provide legal protection for the use of medical marijuana i support that i think that the states are the laboratories of our democracy we should be learning about what works what doesn\t work different states have actually listed the kind of illnesses and conditions that it can be used for are they right we don\t know that\ why we have got to do the research i also want you to know what dosage is right what interacts with the other medication you\re taking i want to accelerate this because i have no doubt that there are very real benefits for people we know in chemotherapy we know from other conditions in using the right amount of the right kind of marijuana i just want to make sure it\ the right amount and the right kind that\ why i want to get that research up and going as quickly as possible but you said something else which i think is really important we can\t be here in new hampshire and not talk about the addiction problem in new hampshire not talk about the fact that there have been more deaths by overdoses than car crashes in this state not talk about the lives that are being destroyed the people that i meet the grandmothers raising their grandchildren because they\ve lost their children i just left a rally in manchester and a woman grabbed my hand and she said i just lost my son to an overdose so i have been working with elected officials like senator shaheen like governor hassan like governor shumlin of vermont who supports me to try to figure out how do we put together a new approach a new law enforcement approach so that firsttime lowlevel drug users are not sent to jail but instead we have more treatment and recovery programs there are 23 million people who need help in our country both alcohol and drugs there are 10 percent of the kind of spaces that they need to take care of those people so we\ve got to work on law enforcement we have to work on doctors to understand better when they prescribe opioids which is often the first step towards heroin we have to have every police department equipped with naloxone which is the antidote to reverse overdose save lives here in new hampshire we\ve got to put more money into this so all of this to me fits together you deserve answers about marijuana and we deserve more treatment for people who are addicted to drugs and alcohol for other kinds of challenges so that\ what i would like to do\n\n\n\nhi\n\n\nhow old are they\n\n\n\nwell first of all tell them i\m glad they\re interested in politics and i really mean that i want them to be involved i want them to feel like i felt when i was that age some years ago and getting excited and interested in politics for the first time\n\ni also want them to take a look at my record what i have done my entire life starting as a young lawyer working for the children\ defense fund taking on the problem of juveniles incarcerated with adults in south carolina trying to gather information to end segregated academies in the south i want them to know that i was a legal services lawyers standing up for equality under the law defending people\ rights because i believe passionately that those of us who have the opportunity to serve should serve and then i hope they will look at what i have accomplished from you know starting the children\ health insurance program that insures eight million kids looking at ways to try to be smart in reforming our adoption and foster care system with very partisan republicans when i was first lady getting healthcare for our national guard helping to negotiate and implement a treaty to reduce nuclear weapons a long list and the reason i say that is i think it\ very important that as people move toward the primary on tuesday whatever your age you really think about what someone is proposing and what their record is about getting it done and as i\ve said and i mean it absolutely i have the highest respect for senator sanders but as the concord monitor said today in its writing about this you know it\ it\ very hard to see how any of his proposals could ever be achievable so i don\t want to over promise we\ve got too much of that i want to tell people what i will do i want to be specific because i do want to  to go back to the question i was asked earlier  recreate the trust that seems to have been splintered in america we need to set big goals again i am all for that i have big ambitious goals affordable college early childhood education making sure that we are on the path to paid family leave all of which will help your daughters but i also want them to hold me accountable i want them to say ok how\ that actually going to happen what do we have to do to make it we\ve got to get 60 votes to break a filibuster in the senate nancy pelosi has said we\re not going to revisit healthcare we\re going to stick with the affordable care act that\ exactly where i am we\re going to improve it because i am somebody who wants to actually produce a real difference in people\ lives i am a progressive who gets results and i will be a progressive president who gets results and the final thing i would say is it is still the case that there are challenges and obstacles to young women\ ambitions and i\m going to try to break the highest and hardest glass ceiling i hope it splinters completely and and i hope for your daughters it opens doors that might not be open right now regardless of whether any of them ever do any politically but in their lives their profession how they\re treated i hope it does give them more of a sense of empowerment that\ what i want for my daughter and my amazing granddaughter and that\ what i want for your daughters\n\n\nyou don\t think they know everything\n\n\n\ni used to do this in the white house and you know i would i would put on a baseball cap and sunglasses and you know sweat pants and a sweat shirt and put my hair back and i would go walk and i would tell the secret service they had to wear casual clothes they had to take the things out of their ears they had to look like they were just tourists i had the best time you know i would i would end up over on the mall sometimes walking around and a family would come up and say would you mind taking our picture in front of the white house i\d be happy to here why don\t you so you know there\ nothing i like better than to be anonymous as hard as that is to achieve so i would spend the day you know out in nature talking a long walk walking through one of the beautiful towns here in new hampshire stopping in a cafe stopping in a bookstore you know maybe calling some of my friends some of whom are here tonight and say don\t tell anybody but meet me you know there that\ what i that\ what i want to do and it\ what i get the great joy out of i am so fortunate that i still have my friends from grade school and every other phase of my life and they keep me grounded they keep me honest they deflate my head they deal with the universe in one pocket and the dust and ashes in the other \n\nso any time i get to spend time with them and then of course it would have to end with seeing my granddaughter because that\ the creme de le resistance\n\n\n\nshe calls me grandma grandma yes she\ working really hard on words and it was so thrilling they came to iowa that last weekend because we obviously weren\t going to leave and so they got in late the night saturday night and sunday morning i\m getting ready and you know bill and i are you know having coffee and everything so chelsea brings her in and she sees me she goes grandma and honest to goodness the caucus could\ve ended right there i would\ve been perfectly happy  saying the best thing has happened to me right this minute in iowa so that\ where i\d end my day\n\n\n\nright\n\n\n\nshe was\n\n\nright\n\n\n\nyou know my mother truly is my inspiration because she had such a terrible miserable life and was abandoned and rejected by her own family and was out at the age of 14 working as a housemaid and her resilience her love her ability to have her own family to take such good care of us was just you know to me the ultimate accomplishment in any life and she would always give me the advice she gave me as a little girl you know you get knocked down everybody gets knocked down what matters is whether you get up and when you get up what do you do how do you behave are you going to be bitter angry upset are you going to try to be positive get something done help somebody else and i\m sure that\ exactly what she\d be saying now she\d be encouraging me she\d be very proud a little apprehensive because you know it\ a brutal business being in politics and people say things about those you love whether it\ your daughter or someone else so she was very supportive but you could tell you know how much pain she kind of absorbed from time to time and so i would sit with her and i would say don\t listen to that stuff mom and she\d say well i have to know what they\re saying about you and i\d say you know don\t put yourself through that and so that would be what she\d be doing now i think too yes\n\n\n\noh\n\n\n\nwell thank you well first of all thanks again for being part of this process this first in the nation primary you know i said earlier today some people said well you know sen sanders is ahead and i respect that and so maybe you know i should go onto the next state and i said absolutely not new hampshire has been so good to me and my family and i love campaigning in new hampshire i love this process so you\re going to have to put up with me i\m going to be going around the state going to as many events as i can answering as many questions trying to talk about what i am offering i really believe that we have a chance to build on the progress we\ve made and to get results for people to get the economy producing more good jobs to get incomes rising again that\ my goal i will not raise middle class taxes because the middle class hasn\t even yet recovered from the great recession we\re going to stick with the affordable care act we\re going to make it work we\re going to get early childhood education affordable college and pay down student debt a lot of the agenda that is important to our country particularly to young people and we\re going to defend our rights we\re going to defend a woman\ right to make her own health care decisions we\re going to defend planned parenthood we\re going to defend marriage equality and end discrimination against lgbt americans and we\re going to take on the gun lobby because it is absolutely unconscionable to have  33000 people a year die from gun violence so please join me in this campaign i hope you will come out and vote for me on tuesday and i will fight for you every single day in the white house thank you all very much cheers and applause\n\n\nthank you all thank you guys
6,oh thank you all so much thank you oh you are great thank you\noh my goodness i\ll tell you it was worth it trying to get here you have been so generous with your time and i\m just so grateful to be back in marshalltown and to have this chance to talk with you now less than a week until the caucus on monday night but it\ just really meaningful to me that you would be here and be part of this process and i really am grateful to each and every one of you\n\ni\ve learned a lot in the last months and i really think that spending all this time in small groups and big ones is going to make me a better president so i thank you for everything you\ve done to make that possible\n\nand i really want to thank mark smith for his endorsement i\m thrilled thank you so very much representative and i have ai have a plan that i hope will come to pass when itthat affects mark and that is i hope that we will be able to make him the majority leader of the house of representatives in the state legislature\n\nthink of all the good things that he could do for you and for people across iowa\n\nwell it\ getting close and when all of you decide to go caucus on monday you\re going to be the first people in the world to get to express an opinion about who should be the next president and commander in chief for our country\n\nand i know how seriously iowans take this because i\ve been talking with you and listening to you but i want to just spend a few minutes really discussing what\ at stake because this is one of the most consequential elections that we\ve had in quite some time\n\nwhen you think about it there are some very big differences between us and the republicans and that puts a special responsibility on you and voters to try to decide where you stand well i will tell you where i stand\n\ni believe that the republican policies that are being promoted by this crop of candidates that are traveling across our state and country would set our country back rip up the progress we\ve made and undermine our future and that is true across the board but let me just pick a few of the most important issues let\ take the economy\n\nyou heard from them they are spouting the same failed economic policies trickledown economics cut taxes on the wealthy get out of the way of corporations we have tried that it does not work and it\ important to know the facts and the facts are that our economy does better when we have a democrat in the white house who cares about creating jobs and raising incomes for americans\n\nand the last two democratic presidents we\ve had both of whom i know which i kind of am proud of they each inherited economic problems from their republican predecessors\n\nyou know in my husband\ case it was a recession a huge national debt that had been quadrupled in the prior 12 years and a big deficit so when he got to washington people said ok so what do you especially bring to washington that can make a difference he said well i guess i bring arithmetic we\re going to make it add up again for the american people and at the end of eight years we did\n\ntwentythree million new jobs but most importantly incomes went up for everybody not just those at the top hardworking middleclass families working families poor families more people were lifted out of poverty than in any recent time in our history and we ended up with a balanced budget and a surplus we were on the right track\n\nwell back came the republicans and back came trickledown economics george w bush slashed taxes on the wealthy and got out of the way of corporations to the extent that the man he put in charge of keeping an eye on wall street took a chainsaw to a big stack of regulations and had a great big smile on his face\n\nnow we know what happened don\t we we went into the greatest financial crisis since the great depression and when barack obama became president we were losing 800000 jobs a month i don\t think president obama gets the credit he deserves for digging us out of that big ditch that the republicans put us in during their administration\n\nand it was not easy i know i talked to him about it when he asked me to be secretary of state he said we got to focus on the economy here at home and we got to fix all the problems that we also inherited around the world\n\nand what did he do well we\re back on track with 14 million new jobs the affordable care act was passed we\re now at 90 percent health care coverage in america for the first time\n\nhe passed and signed the toughest regulations on wall street since the 1930s the doddfrank law saved the auto industry which was on the brink of collapse which would have taken another you know couple of million jobs down with them we ended up losing 9 million because of that great recession 5 million homes were lost and 13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out\n\nnow if you want to go back there you got a lot of folks including one who was here today who are spouting that same stuff because that\ where we\ll end up again in fact you are four times more likely to see a recession in america when you have a republican in the white house\n\nso the economy is going to be at the core of this election so you should ask everybody who\ running what they\re going to do about it and i got to tell you i\m proud of what we\ve been doing on the democratic side we have our differences but we have differences over issues and that\ what we talk about not insults which is what happens among the republicans\n\nso i\ve put out a plan here is what i think we need to do we need more infrastructure jobs our roads our bridges our tunnels our ports our airports our rail systems our sewer systems our water systems we have work to do in our country and those are jobs that can\t be exported they need to be done right here and put americans back to work building our economy making us more competitive\n\nand then we\re going to take the tax system and get rid of the incentives that actually encourage people to take jobs and move them overseas take factories and build them overseas we\re going to reverse that so we start investing in america again advance manufacturing i know it can be done because i\ve been to some of your community colleges i have seen the work that is happening there the training that is going on\n\ni also know it can be done because while we are going to combat climate change we\re going to create more clean renewable energy jobs and that will be a huge economic opportunityapplausethat is directly linked to what iowa has been doing\n\nyou know the republicans when you ask them about climate change they all say the same thing well i don\t know i\m not a scientist you know there\ an easy way to remedy that go talk to a scientist listen to a scientist learn about what\ going on and you know that\ bad enough that they\re into denial what really is troubling is they\re missing this huge economic opportunity\n\nand when i tell people that i see you know sometimes folks around the country have a little bit of skepticism on their faces and here\ what i tell them i know we can create those jobs because look at what iowa has done\n\nand i want you to thank representative smith thank you and it started with tom vilsack and the democrats making a commitment iowa now gets onethird of your electricity from renewable sources mostly wind\n\nyou have 7000 people already working in the wind industry in this state you are doing research on advanced biofuels that the defense department thinks may be able to fuel navy vessels and air force planes so iowa is in the forefront of the energy revolution because some country is going to be the 21st century clean energy superpower it\ either going to be china germany or us i want it to be us and we need to make up our minds that it is going to be us and we\re going to be doing the technology the innovation and exporting to the rest of the world\n\nwe also need to be focusing on small business because that\ where most of the jobs come from in america and i want to be the small business president my dad was a small businessman so i want to clear away all the underbrush so people can start businesses again and especially young people s lot of young people tell me they\d love to go into business but they can\t get credit part of it is they have such student debts they can\t get credit we\ve got to fix that so we need to make it easier to start and grow a small business\n\nnow there are two ways we can raise incomes real quick one we\ve got to raise the minimum wage people who work full time should not still be in poverty\n\nthere should be a ladder of opportunity and the other way is to guarantee equal pay for women\ work and that will raise incomes and families will be better off the economy will be\n\nnow everything i\ve just said to you the republicans don\t agree with it every bit of it they don\t believe in any of it they don\t really tell you what they will do except just you know get out of the way and let corporations do whatever they want and let their you know big donors do whatever they want well that\ not going to work we know it won\t and we can\t be sold that bill of goods again\n\nthe other thing we have to do is to change the tax system so that it is fairer and i\m am the only candidate running on either side who has made this pledge i will raise your incomes i will not raise middleclass taxes i do not think it is rightapplauseto be going to people who suffered because of the republican recession and asking for you to help us make the investments for the future i want you to take advantage of them but i want to go where the money is and the money is at the top and that\ where we need to be shifting our tax system so we need to close the loopholes and the special gimmicks that corporations and the wealthy use like this thing called the carried interest loophole that i\ve been against for years\n\nwe also need to do what warren buffett suggested i was really very happy that he endorsed me and i went to omaha with him and we were standing there and heapplausehe said you know i\m not too popular among my rich friends these days because i think people like me should pay more money into our tax system to support our country and he has something he calls the buffett rule anybody who makes 1 million should have to pay a 30 percent effective tax rate so i\ve adopted the buffett rule and we\re going to go right at it and try to get that done\n\nand then i want to go further i want to impose what i call a fair share surcharge on incomes of 5 million or more now there aren\t very many of those but there\ a lot of money there because i want to use that money to make college affordable i want to use that money to invest in clean energy i want to use that money to move toward paid family leave so that families get more support to be able to do their work at home and take care of their families i want to use that money to help bring down the cost of child care which in some states is as expensive as college tuition there are things we can do that will relieve the burdens on middleclass families and the money should come from those who have it\n\nnow people say to me well how are we ever going to get that done well i do have a political strategy i\ve seen a little bit of this in the last 20plus years there are not that many people who make 5 million or more in america and i think we can make a very clear case\n\nmr congressman over there are you in favor of clean energy and affordable college are you in favor of early childhood education and the way we\re going to get it is to tax the two people in your district who make more than 5 million or are you going to deny that to the 350000 people who live in your district\n\nwe\re going to make a very tough case about why we have to make the tax code fairer you know you can talk about it but i have a plan to do it not just a plan on the substance but a political plan because i want you to know what i aim to do for you and what it will cost you and i want everybody to be able to look at that and make your own judgment\n\ni also have what has been described as the toughest most effective comprehensive plan to go after wall street\n\nnow i totally agree with my two esteemed opponents senator sanders and governor o\malley that we\ve got to keep our eyes on the big banks and no bank is too big to fail and no executive is too powerful to jail but we already have the authority to go after them that was in the doddfrank bill we don\t have to do that we just have to implement it and i have said if they pose a systemic risk to our economy i will go after them and i will use the process president obama signed into law\n\nbut here\ where i differ with my two friendsthat is not enough and this is what we\ve been arguing about on the debate stage you see it wasn\t just the big banks that caused our problems it was an investment bank like lehman brothers it was a big insurance conglomerate called aig it was a mortgage company called countrywide it was another bank not one of the big five called wachovia and others who are in what is called the shadow banking sector\n\nso what i\ve is we\re going after risk wherever it is in the financial system and paul krugman the nobel prizewinning economist said i have the best plan barney frank who is actually the frank in doddfrank said i have the best plan because i\m trying to look not just at what happened in the past to prevent that from happening again but what could happen in the future\n\nand you know the best evidence i have that i have the best plan is that the republicans and their billionaire allies are running ads against me you know it started a few weeks ago these two hedge fund billionaires formed a super pac to run ads against me to convince democrats not to support me and then along came karl rove you know the errand boy for the billionaires and he\ now running an ad against me and now another billionaire has jumped in and he\ now running an ad against me\n\nnow you got to stop to think why are they spending all this money to try to convince democrats not to support me well i think you know the answer because they know that i say what i mean i do what i say i will do and i know how to get it done to take after them to prevent them fromapplausepushing an agenda on us that hurts the economy\n\nnow another area where i have very strong feelings and share exactly the same goal as senator sanders is health care you know i believe in universal health care coverage every american should have it you know before it was called obamacare it was called hillarycare back in \93 and \94 when i was trying to get universal health care and we were not successful and that was really disappointing\n\ni mean the drug companies the insurance companies spent millions of dollars against us so we didn\t succeed and then i got to thinking well what can i do now because you know my view is when you\re knocked down you share the human experience because everybody gets knocked down about something the real question is whether you get back up so i started thinking what can i do that can help somebody make a difference in their lives\n\nand i remembered when i was traveling around the country trying to get universal health care meeting so many people who did not have health insurance they couldn\t afford it they had a preexisting condition and the insurance companies wouldn\t give it to them and i met so many really good decent people who are so overwhelmed by what was happening to them and i remember i was at the children\ hospital in cleveland i was meeting with a group of parents whose kids were really sick with chronic diseases and one man said to me he said you know i\ve gone everywhere to try to get insurance for my daughters i have two girls with cystic fibrosis and nobody will sell it to me\n\ni said what do they say when you go ask them and you tell them you want to try to pay for something they say no he said i\ll tell you what the last person told me at the insurance company i visited he said we don\t insure burning houses this man said they called my little girls burning houses and that stuck with me that and the stories i heard so i started to work with democrats and republicans and we created the children\ health insurance program and it now insures eight million kids because when you getapplauseyou encounter an obstacle you run into a problem you\ve got to keep going you can\t ever stop if you\re trying to accomplish something that will help other people and i was thrilled when the president passed and signed the affordable care act\n\nwe\ve been trying to get thatthe democratic party has been trying to get that accomplished since harry truman and now i meet people all the time who are benefiting from it i want to build on it and i want to improve it you know the republicans want to repeal it and that\ what they\ll do if they get the white house back we can\t let that happen\n\nhere is what i want to do i want to decrease costs outofpocket costs decrease prescription drug costs\n\ni want to make sure that we get the authority for medicare to negotiate for lower drug costs with the drug companies i want to go after the predatory pricing that drug companies are using to raise the price of drugs i want to take away their tax benefits they actually get a tax benefit for advertising all that stuff on tv to us that we neveri can\t understand what they\re talking about\n\nthey have people walking through fields of wildflowers walking on beaches they have the name of the drug which you know is unpronounceable and then in a low voice under the music they have somebody saying if you take this drug you know your nose will fall off i mean itlaughterdrives you crazy and they spend more money advertising on tv than they spend on research so we\re going to go right at them we\re going to take them on on this\n\nbut i don\t want to start over my friends that\ the disagreement i have with senator sanders i want us to build on what we have and make it better and go from 90 percent coverage to 100 percent of americans i don\t want to start at zero and have toapplausefight it all over again have to have the national battle we that we had on health care over the last 25 years so i\m determined that we\re going to make this work for everybody and i know it\ the right thing to do and i hope that you know we will be able to get your costs down your copays your deductibles what you know a lot of people are telling me are starting to pinch again\n\ni also will defend social security against privatization the republicans still want to privatize it they\re still talking about that it\ a terrible idea and you know the worst part of the idea is they want to turn the entire social security trust fund over to wall street that\ what this is all about take all that money that people have been paying in for you know 75 80 years and turn it over to wall street i will never let that happen that is the worstapplauseidea that is imaginable\n\ni will also not let them voucherize medicare something else they want to do and i will not let them privatize the va we have to fix the va but we are not going to take away guaranteed benefits from our veterans who have earned them through their service that\ not going to happen\n\nand when it comes to foreign policy and national security well i think we have a lot to do to keep our country safe and i have some ideas that i\ve been putting out based on what i did in the senate after 9/11 based on my work as secretary of state\n\nit\ imperative that we do everything we can to defeat isis to stop the flow of foreign fighters and funding to fight them on the internet where they\re quite effective without putting american troops back on the ground in either syria or iraq\n\nthat will not happen it\ notit\ not going to happen on my watch and then we have to do a better job working with federal state and local law enforcement to keep us safe at home and we have to do a better job sharing intelligence getting intelligence that will help us prevent attacks\n\nwhen i was a senator after 9/11 i\d be kept uptodate on all the threats that still were facing new york and we had a very very dedicated group of police and federal law enforcement and everyone who worked together but you know one of the best things we did was a campaign which said if you see something suspicious or you hear something suspicious report it and so people were picking up the phone and telling the police or maybe calling the fbi and it really provided kind of thethe eyeson help that we needed and people could then follow up and we prevented attacks we foiled attacks\n\nwell the reason i mention that is because of this the republican candidates led by their frontrunner have been attacking muslims right you\ve heard that attacking american muslims attacking muslims around the world that\ not only shameful it\ dangerous we need everybody in this country to be on the same team when it comes to preventing terrorist attacks\n\nand we need people who are in the community who hear something see something to report it and not feel like they\re being demonized defamed insulted pushed out and certainly if we\re going to defeat isis we need a coalition that includes muslim nations\n\nnow i can tell you i built the coalition that imposed sanctions on iran i know a little bit about how you do this you don\t start by insulting people\ religion and then ask them to be part of your effort to defeat a common adversary\n\nthat\ not the way it works in the real world so we have to be smart about how we protect ourselves and that will be my highest priority\n\ni also want to continue to move toward comprehensive immigration reform which i think is in the best interest of our country and our economy\n\nand i want to let you know where i stand on a lot of the issues that the republicans have taken positions on because they seem to be against so many of the fundamental rights that i support\n\ni am for a woman\ righta woman\ right to make her own health decisions and i am against defunding planned parenthood\n\ni am for marriage equality and against discrimination against the lgbt community i am against citizens united which is a terrible decision that has opened the doors to floods of unaccountable money from the koch brothers and others and i would do everything i can to reverse that decision\n\ni also want to keep pushing for criminal justice reform and reform in the incarceration system and i want to fight for common sense gun safety measures that will help keep americans safe without infringing on gun owners\ rights\n\nwe are a smartwe are a smart people we can do this and what i don\t understand is how when we know we have on average 90 people a day dying from gun violence 33000 people a year we cannot figure out how to protect people protect firstgraders going to school people going to a movie theater churchgoers going to bible study we can do this we can\t stop every murder or every suicide or every tragic avoidable accident but we can stop a lot of them without infringing on anybody\ rights\n\nand 92 percent of the american people agree with that and 85 percent of gun owners agree with that so we need somebody who will stand up to the gun lobby and stop them from intimidating common sense reforms in our country\n\nso we have a lot of work to do my friends and you have been really patient the children who are still here have been especially patient and i don\t want to keep you any longer\n\ni just want to say a few closing comments and then for those of you who want to stay i will shake your hands and take pictures and you can ask me questions but everybody else can go home and not feel bad about it because i need you to get up tomorrow and help work to get more people to go to the caucus next monday\n\nand you know i am all abouti am all about making progress against the odds i am all about working with people i worked with republicans as first lady as senator as secretary of state i worked to get results for the people i represented in the senate as well as our country i worked when i was secretary of state to make our country safe and to have our values and interests promoted and i know how to find common ground because i\ve done it\n\ni don\t think thati think ii do believe that probably every republican i served with at one time or another sponsored a piece of my legislation actually when i\m not running for something they say nice things about me laughter\n\neven in the case of mr trump they give me money because they think i\m so good as a candidate and a senator so you know this is politics this is all that that goes on\n\nbut once the election is over i will work as hard as i can to find that common ground to get good things to happen for you for your families for your country and make it possible for young people to feel like i felt that you know really the american dream was available you had to work for it but if you did you could get ahead and stay ahead that\ what i think about when it comes to my granddaughter you know i am the granddaughter of a factory worker she is the granddaughter of a former president i think it shouldn\t matter the grandchildren of everybody should have the same opportunities in our country\n\nand that\ what i am going to stand up for and fight for and with your help starting at the caucus next monday night that\ what we will do together thank you all so much
7,thank you thank you so much thank you all very much thank you thank you san diego for that warm warm welcome and thanks to ellen for those moving words her introduction and for reminding us it\ not only our men and women in uniform that serve our country it\ their families their spouses their children and we are grateful to each and every one of them i want to recognize and thank congressman scott peters for being here thank you very much\nand all of the other electeds and service members active duty and retired national guard and reservists veterans military spouses family members all who are with us today\n\non monday we observed memorial day  a day that means a great deal to san diego home of so many activeduty and former military and their families we honor the sacrifice of those who died for our country in many ways  by living our values by making this a stronger and fairer nation and by carrying out a smart and principled foreign policy\n\nthat\ what i want to speak about today  the challenges we face in protecting our country and the choice at stake in this election\n\nit\ a choice between a fearful america that\ less secure and less engaged with the world and a strong confident america that leads to keep our country safe and our economy growing\n\nas secretary of state senator and first lady i had the honor of representing america abroad and helping shape our foreign policy at home as a candidate for president there\ nothing i take more seriously than our national security i\ve offered clear strategies for how to defeat isis strengthen our alliances and make sure iran never gets a nuclear weapon and i\m going to keep america\ security at the heart of my campaign\n\nbecause as you know so well americans aren\t just electing a president in november we\re choosing our next commanderinchief  the person we count on to decide questions of war and peace life and death\n\nand like many across our country and around the world i believe the person the republicans have nominated for president cannot do the job\n\ndonald trump\ ideas aren\t just different  they are dangerously incoherent they\re not even really ideas  just a series of bizarre rants personal feuds and outright lies\n\nhe is not just unprepared  he is temperamentally unfit to hold an office that requires knowledge stability and immense responsibility\n\nthis is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes  because it\ not hard to imagine donald trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin\n\nwe cannot put the security of our children and grandchildren in donald trump\ hands we cannot let him roll the dice with america\n\nthis is a man who said that more countries should have nuclear weapons including saudi arabia\n\nthis is someone who has threatened to abandon our allies in nato  the countries that work with us to root out terrorists abroad before they strike us at home\n\nhe believes we can treat the us economy like one of his casinos and default on our debts to the rest of the world which would cause an economic catastrophe far worse than anything we experienced in 2008\n\nhe has said that he would order our military to carry out torture and the murder of civilians who are related to suspected terrorists  even though those are war crimes\n\nhe says he doesn\t have to listen to our generals or our admirals our ambassadors and other high officials because he has  quote  \a very good brain\\n\nhe also said \i know more about isis than the generals do believe me\ you know what i don\t believe him\n\nhe says climate change is a hoax invented by the chinese and he has the gall to say that prisoners of war like john mccain aren\t heroes\n\nhe praises dictators like vladimir putin and picks fights with our friends  including the british prime minister the mayor of london the german chancellor the president of mexico and the pope\n\nhe says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the miss universe pageant in russia\n\nand to top it off he believes america is weak an embarrassment he called our military a disaster he said we are  and i quote  a \thirdworld country\ and he\ been saying things like that for decades\n\nthose are the words my friends of someone who doesn\t understand america or the world\n\nand they\re the words of someone who would lead us in the wrong direction because if you really believe america is weak  with our military our values our capabilities that no other country comes close to matching  then you don\t know america\n\nand you certainly don\t deserve to lead it\n\nthat\ why  even if i weren\t in this race  i\d be doing everything i could to make sure donald trump never becomes president  because i believe he will take our country down a truly dangerous path\n\nunlike him i have some experience with the tough calls and the hard work of statecraft i wrestled with the chinese over a climate deal in copenhagen brokered a ceasefire between israel and hamas negotiated the reduction of nuclear weapons with russia twisted arms to bring the world together in global sanctions against iran and stood up for the rights of women religious minorities and lgbt people around the world\n\nand i have i have sat in the situation room and advised the president on some of the toughest choices he faced\n\nso i\m not new to this work and i\m proud to run on my record because i think the choice before the american people in this election is clear\n\ni believe in strong alliances clarity in dealing with our rivals and a rocksolid commitment to the values that have always made america great and i believe with all my heart that america is an exceptional country  that we\re still in lincoln\ words the last best hope of earth we are not a country that cowers behind walls we lead with purpose and we prevail\n\nand if america doesn\t lead we leave a vacuum  and that will either cause chaos or other countries will rush in to fill the void then they\ll be the ones making the decisions about your lives and jobs and safety  and trust me the choices they make will not be to our benefit\n\nthat is not an outcome we can live with\n\nas i see it there are some important things our next president must do to secure american leadership and keep us safe and our economy growing in the years ahead these are all areas in which donald trump and i profoundly disagree and they are all critical to our future\n\nfirst we need to be strong at home\n\nthat means investing in our infrastructure education and innovation  the fundamentals of a strong economy we need to reduce income inequality because our country can\t lead effectively when so many are struggling to provide the basics for their families and we need to break down the barriers that hold americans back including barriers of bigotry and discrimination\n\ncompare that with what trump wants to do his economic plans would add more than 30 trillion  that\ trillion with a \t\  30 trillion to our national debt over the next 20 years he has no ideas on education no ideas on innovation he has a lot of ideas about who to blame but no clue about what to do\n\nnone of what donald trump is offering will make america stronger at home and that would make us weaker in the world\n\nsecond we need to stick with our allies\n\namerica\ network of allies is part of what makes us exceptional and our allies deliver for us every day\n\nour armed forces fight terrorists together our diplomats work side by side allies provide staging areas for our military so we can respond quickly to events on the other side of the world and they share intelligence that helps us identify and defuse potential threats\n\ntake the threat posed by north korea  perhaps the most repressive regime on the planet run by a sadistic dictator who wants to develop longrange missiles that could carry a nuclear weapon to the united states\n\nwhen i was secretary of state we worked closely with our allies japan and south korea to respond to this threat including by creating a missile defense system that stands ready to shoot down a north korean warhead should its leaders ever be reckless enough to launch one at us the technology is ours key parts of it are located on japanese ships all three countries contributed to it and this month all three of our militaries will run a joint drill to test it\n\nthat\ the power of allies\n\nand it\ the legacy of american troops who fought and died to secure those bonds because they knew we were safer with friends and partners\n\nnow moscow and beijing are deeply envious of our alliances around the world because they have nothing to match them they\d love for us to elect a president who would jeopardize that source of strength if donald gets his way they\ll be celebrating in the kremlin we cannot let that happen\n\nthat\ why it is no small thing when he talks about leaving nato or says he\ll stay neutral on israel\ security\n\nit\ no small thing when he calls mexican immigrants rapists and murderers we\re lucky to have two friendly neighbors on our land borders why would he want to make one of them an enemy\n\nand it\ no small thing when he suggests that america should withdraw our military support for japan encourage them to get nuclear weapons and said this about a war between japan and north korea  and i quote  \if they do they do good luck enjoy yourself folks\ i wonder if he even realizes he\ talking about nuclear war\n\nyes our friends need to contribute their fair share i made that point long before donald trump came onto the scene  and a number of them have increased their defense spending the real debate here is whether we keep these alliances strong or cut them off what he says would weaken our country\n\nthird we need to embrace all the tools of american power especially diplomacy and development to be on the frontlines solving problems before they threaten us at home\n\ndiplomacy is often the only way to avoid a conflict that could end up exacting a much greater cost it takes patience persistence and an eye on the long game  but it\ worth it\n\ntake the nuclear agreement with iran when president obama took office iran was racing toward a nuclear bomb some called for military action but that could have ignited a broader war that could have mired our troops in another middle eastern conflict\n\npresident obama chose a different path and i got to work leading the effort to impose crippling global sanctions we brought iran to the table we began talks and eventually we reached an agreement that should block every path for iran to get a nuclear weapon\n\nnow we must enforce that deal vigorously and as i\ve said many times before our approach must be \distrust and verify\ the world must understand that the united states will act decisively if necessary including with military action to stop iran from getting a nuclear weapon in particular israel\ security is nonnegotiable they\re our closest ally in the region and we have a moral obligation to defend them\n\nbut there is no question that the world and the united states we are safer now than we were before this agreement and we accomplished it without firing a single shot dropping a single bomb or putting a single american soldier in harm\ way\n\ndonald trump says we shouldn\t have done the deal we should have walked away but that would have meant no more global sanctions and iran resuming their nuclear program and the world blaming us so then what war telling the world good luck you deal with iran\n\nof course trump doesn\t have answers to those questions donald trump doesn\t know the first thing about iran or its nuclear program ask him it\ll become very clear very quickly\n\nthere\ no risk of people losing their lives if you blow up a golfcourse deal\n\nbut it doesn\t work like that in world affairs just like being interviewed on the same episode of 60 minutes as putin was is not the same thing as actually dealing with putin\n\nso the stakes in global statecraft are infinitely higher and more complex than in the world of luxury hotels we all know the tools donald trump brings to the table  bragging mocking composing nasty tweets  i\m willing to bet he\ writing a few right now\n\nbut those tools won\t do the trick rather than solving global crises he would create new ones\n\nhe has no sense of what it takes to deal with multiple countries with competing interests and reaching a solution that everyone can get behind in fact he is downright contemptuous of that work and that means he\ much more likely to end up leading us into conflict\n\nfourth we need to be firm but wise with our rivals\n\ncountries like russia and china often work against us beijing dumps cheap steel in our markets that hurts american workers moscow has taken aggressive military action in ukraine right on nato\ doorstep now i\ve gone toetotoe with russia and china and many other different leaders around the world so i know we have to be able to both stand our ground when we must and find common ground when we can\n\nthat\ how i could work with russia to conclude the new start treaty to reduce nuclear stockpiles and with china to increase pressure on north korea it\ how our diplomats negotiated the landmark agreement on climate change which trump now wants to rip up\n\nthe key was never forgetting who we were dealing with  not friends or allies but countries that share some common interests with us amid many disagreements\n\ndonald doesn\t see the complexity he wants to start a trade war with china and i understand a lot of americans have concerns about our trade agreements  i do too but a trade war is something very different we went down that road in the 1930s it made the great depression longer and more painful combine that with his comments about defaulting on our debt and it\ not hard to see how a trump presidency could lead to a global economic crisis\n\nand i have to say i don\t understand donald\ bizarre fascination with dictators and strongmen who have no love for america he praised china for the tiananmen square massacre he said it showed strength he said \you\ve got to give kim jong un credit\ for taking over north korea  something he did by murdering everyone he saw as a threat including his own uncle which donald described gleefully like he was recapping an action movie and he said if he were grading vladimir putin as a leader he\d give him an \a\\n\nnow i\ll leave it to the psychiatrists to explain his affection for tyrants\n\ni just wonder how anyone could be so wrong about who america\ real friends are because it matters if you don\t know exactly who you\re dealing with men like putin will eat your lunch\n\nfifth we need a real plan for confronting terrorists\n\nas we saw six months ago in san bernardino the threat is real and urgent over the past year i\ve laid out my plans for defeating isis\n\nwe need to take out their strongholds in iraq and syria by intensifying the air campaign and stepping up our support for arab and kurdish forces on the ground we need to keep pursuing diplomacy to end syria\ civil war and close iraq\ sectarian divide because those conflicts are keeping isis alive we need to lash up with our allies and ensure our intelligence services are working handinhand to dismantle the global network that supplies money arms propaganda and fighters to the terrorists we need to win the battle in cyberspace\n\nand of course we need to strengthen our defenses here at home\n\nthat  in a nutshell  is my plan for defeating isis\n\nwhat\ trump\ well he won\t say he is literally keeping it a secret the secret of course is he has no idea what he\d do to stop isis\n\njust look at the few things he\ actually said on the subject\n\nhe\ actually said  and i quote \maybe syria should be a free zone for isis\ oh okay  let a terrorist group have control of a major country in the middle east\n\nthen he said we should send tens of thousands of american ground troops to the middle east to fight isis\n\nhe also refused to rule out using nuclear weapons against isis which would mean mass civilian casualties\n\nit\ clear he doesn\t have a clue what he\ talking about so we can\t be certain which of these things he would do but we can be certain that he\ capable of doing any or all of them letting isis run wild launching a nuclear attack starting a ground war these are all distinct possibilities with donald trump in charge\n\nand through all his loose talk there\ one constant theme demonizing muslims and playing right into the hands of isis\ his proposal to ban 15 billion muslims from even coming to our country doesn\t just violate the religious freedom our country was founded on it\ also a huge propaganda victory for isis and it alienates the very countries we need to actually help us in this fight\n\na trump presidency would embolden isis we cannot take that risk\n\nthis isn\t reality television  this is actual reality\n\nand defeating global terrorist networks and protecting the homeland takes more than empty talk and a handful of slogans it takes a real plan real experience and real leadership donald trump lacks all three\n\nand one more thing a president has a sacred responsibility to send our troops into battle only if we absolutely must and only with a clear and wellthoughtout strategy our troops give their all they deserve a commanderinchief who knows that\n\ni\ve worked sidebyside with admirals and generals and visited our troops in theaters of war i\ve fought for better health care for our national guard better services for our veterans and more support for our gold star families we cannot put the lives of our young men and women in uniform in donald trump\ hands\n\nsixth we need to stay true to our values\n\ntrump says over and over again \the world is laughing at us\ he\ been saying this for decades he didn\t just start this year\n\nhe bought fullpage ads in newspapers across the country back in 1987 when ronald reagan was president saying that america lacked a backbone and the world was  you guessed it  laughing at us he was wrong then and he\ wrong now  and you\ve got to wonder why somebody who fundamentally has so little confidence in america and has felt that way for at least 30 years wants to be our president\n\nthe truth is there\ not a country in the world that can rival us it\ not just that we have the greatest military or that our economy is larger more durable more entrepreneurial than any in the world it\ also that americans work harder dream bigger  and we never ever stop trying to make our country and world a better place\n\nso it really matters that donald trump says things that go against our deepestheld values it matters when he says he\ll order our military to murder the families of suspected terrorists during the raid to kill bin laden when every second counted our seals took the time to move the women and children in the compound to safety donald trump may not get it but that\ what honor looks like\n\nand it also matters when he makes fun of disabled people calls women pigs proposes banning an entire religion from our country or plays coy with white supremacists america stands up to countries that treat women like animals or people of different races religions or ethnicities as less human\n\nwhat happens to the moral example we set  for the world and for our own children  if our president engages in bigotry\n\nand by the way mr trump  every time you insult american muslims or mexican immigrants remember that plenty of muslims and immigrants serve and fight in our armed forces\n\ndonald trump donald trump could learn something from them\n\nthat brings me to the final point i want to make today  the temperament it takes to be commanderinchief\n\nevery president faces hard choices every day with imperfect information and conflicting imperatives that\ the job\n\na revolution threatens to topple a government in a key region an adversary reaches out for the first time in years  what do you do\n\nmaking the right call takes a cool head and respect for the facts it takes a willingness to listen to other people\ points of view with a truly open mind it also takes humility  knowing you don\t know everything  because if you\re convinced you\re always right you\ll never ask yourself the hard questions\n\ni remember being in the situation room with president obama debating the potential bin laden operation the president\ advisors were divided the intelligence was compelling but far from definitive the risks of failure were daunting the stakes were significant for our battle against al qaeda and our relationship with pakistan most of all the lives of those brave seals and helicopter pilots hung in the balance\n\nit was a decision only the president could make and when he did it was as crisp and courageous a display of leadership as i\ve ever seen\n\nnow imagine donald trump sitting in the situation room making lifeordeath decisions on behalf of the united states imagine him deciding whether to send your spouses or children into battle imagine if he had not just his twitter account at his disposal when he\ angry but america\ entire arsenal\n\ndo we want him making those calls  someone thinskinned and quick to anger who lashes out at the smallest criticism do we want his finger anywhere near the button\n\ni have a lot of faith that the american people will make the right decision this is a country with a deep reservoir of common sense and national pride we\re all counting on that\n\nbecause making donald trump our commanderinchief would be a historic mistake it would undo so much of the work that republicans and democrats alike have done over many decades to make america stronger and more secure it would set back our standing in the world more than anything in recent memory and it would fuel an ugly narrative about who we are  that we\re fearful not confident that we want to let others determine our future for us instead of shaping our own destiny\n\nthat\ not the america i know and love\n\nso yes we have a lot of work to do to keep our country secure and we need to do better by american families and american workers  and we will but don\t let anyone tell you that america isn\t great donald trump\ got america all wrong we are a bighearted fairminded country\n\nthere is no challenge we can\t meet no goal we can\t achieve when we each do our part and come together as one nation\n\nevery lesson from our history teaches us that we are stronger together we remember that every memorial day\n\nthis election is a choice between two very different visions of america\n\none that\ angry afraid and based on the idea that america is fundamentally weak and in decline\n\nthe other is hopeful generous and confident in the knowledge that america is great  just like we always have been\n\nlet\ resolve that we can be greater still that is what i believe in my heart\n\ni went to 112 countries as your secretary of state and i never lost my sense of pride at seeing our blueandwhite plane lit up on some faroff runway with \the united states of america\ emblazoned on the side that plane  those words  our country represents something special not just to us to the world it represents freedom and hope and opportunity\n\ni love this country and i know you do too it\ been an honor and a privilege to serve america and i\m going to do

8,thank you! wow! hello akron! wow! i am so excited! it just fabulous being back here again i am so grateful to all of you i want to thank your mayor mayor horrigan thank you for welcoming me here i want to thank two great members of congress who fight for akron fight for cleveland fight for youngstown fight for ohio and america congresswoman marcia fudge and congressman tim ryan\nnow im pretty excited about being here today and i was especially honored to receive the endorsement of lebron james now i may become president but he will be king of ohio for as long as there is a king im obviously delighted to be endorsed by someone who has demonstrated such leadership and such extraordinary ability but ill tell you what really moved me the most is he given back to his hometown he has advocated for small businesses for kids giving kids more opportunities he spoken out on behalf of criminal justice reform he is someone who uses the platform he has earned because he has worked so hard over so many years to speak out and speak up for those who may not have a voice so i am truly honored to have his support and especially to be able to tell people in his hometown how i am looking forward not just to watch him play basketball but to continue to be a leader in so many different ways\n\nnow we do have an important election coming up who here is planning to vote well that is very good news because this is the most consequential election i think in our lifetimes the choice could not be clearer and we need everybody to show up and how many of you still have to register to be able to vote everybody here registered well i want you to talk to your friends because the deadline for registering in ohio is october 11th that just a little over a week away and if youre not sure

days you can text join join at 47246 and get involved because we are running to win ohio in this election\n\nand everybody everybody in the campaign is crisscrossing ohio my daughter been here a bunch tim kaine and his wonderful wife anne have been here my husband coming back tomorrow for a twoday bus tour through ohio and i will be back because we care about ohio and we want to make sure ohio makes the best choice for the future of the people of this great state\n\nnow im going to close this campaign the way that i started my career a long time ago fighting for kids and families standing up for people who may need a little extra boost in life making sure that this country delivers on the promise of the american dream see i believe the american dream is big enough for everybody if youre willing to work for it and do your part you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead in america\n\nnow my opponent and i have a really different view about what it takes to get ahead and stay ahead and that may be because we have very different life experiences and that okay people have different families different views of the world but here what i have noticed i have noticed that he always puts himself first and maybe that because he was born into a millionaire family he started his business with a 14 million loan from his father his father bailed him out apparently that a pattern you got to be bailed out when you do business with him and he then has taken advantage of every single element of our tax code of our economy that he could\n\nand along the way along the way he has stiffed people  small businesses and workers and contractors and that part of the reason i take this election so seriously my dad was a small businessman my grandfather was a factory worker and so my dad when he got out of the navy in world war ii he started a small business he started a printing business he printed fabrics for draperies and he worked really hard he had a print plant in chicago  no natural light no windows just a long room where there were two big long tables and the fabric would be laid out on them and then if youve ever seen silkscreens that what he did you take the silkscreen you put it down you pour the paint in you take the squeegee you go across you lift it up you go down to the end of one long table you start on the end of the other long table and then if it was going to be two colors you would add another color doing exactly the same thing it was before there was machines my dad couldnt have afforded that anyway but he worked really hard and he produced a good middle class life for our family\n\nand so when i think about the way that my opponent has taken advantage of people i got to tell you i am really grateful my dad never got a contract from him because i have met people he stiffed i have met people im talking painters and plumbers im talking dishwashers marble installers glass installers architects a man who sold him pianos for one of his casinos he wouldnt pay them now you got to stop and ask yourself what kind of person does that somebody who works hard and has a contract which they expect to be honored\n\nand so i met one of the men i met a man who had a small family business installed the glass in one of those casinos submitted the bill and trump said no were not going to pay it and the man was stunned as so many hundreds and hundreds of people have been and then they come back the trump organization or trump himself and say okay well give you 10 cents 20 cents maybe 30 cents on the dollar now some of those small businesses they couldnt afford that they had bought the material they had provided the services trump didnt care he basically just walked away from them made them feel like they had failed even though they had done the work theyd been asked to provide i got to tell you that is not the way were supposed to do business in america and i cant imagine having a president who believes that that the way youre supposed to treat people but youre going to help me make sure he never gets near the white house\n\nnow earlier today earlier today in toledo i talked about all of the changes i want to make in how we can protect americans from the kind of corporate fraud that we have seen too much of now the most recent example is wells fargo wells fargo actually had people thousands of their employees putting customers into accounts they either never asked for or they did not understand and then every time they put somebody into a new account they got fees which then gave them the chance to get a bigger bonus  a really crummy game that hurt people so thankfully we have an organization now the consumer finance protection bureau in washington who looks out for people who get  that is an important part of how were going to protect and it run you may know by richard cordray from ohio\n\nnow will it surprise you that donald trump wants to eliminate that agency well were not going to let that happen that agency has already recovered 11 billion for consumers whove been taken advantage of by corporations and the behavior of wells fargo shows clearly that we have got to keep the pressure on these big banks so they can never wreck the economy again the way they did back in 2008\n\ni have said were never going to let wall street wreck main street again and i mean it contrast that  contrast that with my opponent he wants to do away with the rules that have been imposed on wall street he basically wants to let wall street the banks the hedge funds all these other institutions basically do whatever they want again well ill tell you what were not going to let that happen we need more rules not fewer rules on them\n\ni want us to make it easier to start a small business to get rid of the red tape to make credit available to make it clear that most new jobs are going to come from small businesses in america so we should have a big dynamic small business economy but we are not going to let big business and big corporations call the shots anymore that is not working for us\n\nbut trump whole economic vision is really trickledown economics it the same  the same idea that has failed us before you see he believes that all you do is cut taxes on the wealthy and then it trickles down well we know that doesnt work weve been down that road and what he wants to do is i think it fair to say trickledown on steroids what he has proposed would slash taxes on the wealthy\n\nnow im a little confused about this because for a long time weve been saying hey where are your tax returns a lot of us wondered what he was hiding because you know if it was something that would make him look good he would put them right out there everybody who ever run for president in at least the last 40 years has released their tax returns my husband and i have about 40 years of tax returns out there you can go and look at them and you can see that we paid a lot of taxes and frankly we were grateful we could we are grateful for the blessings that weve had over the last 15 years\n\nso did any of you see the debate last monday well i raised it i said well maybe he doesnt want us to see that he owes hundreds of millions of dollars to foreign banks and foreign lenders or maybe he hasnt paid any taxes now shortly after the debate it was discovered that indeed back in the 1990s he apparently lost a billion dollars on bad investments and failing casinos ask yourself this who loses money on casinos really and yesterday some of his supporters said well it just shows he a genius that he didnt pay any taxes well what kind of genius loses a billion dollars in the first place\n\nin the debate he said not paying taxes made him smart but think about what that means it means that all the rest of us who pay our taxes right  what he saying about us but more than that zero taxes means zero for our vets zero for our military zero for pell grants to send young people to college zero for health zero for education and you stop and ask yourself this is the same person who been going around really just dumping on america he says our military a disaster well he could not be more wrong but thank goodness the rest of us paid to support our men and women in uniform who have done so much for us\n\ntoday in colorado he claimed he brilliantly used the laws to avoid paying taxes well that just shows number one he is the poster boy  the poster boy  for the same rigged system that he would make even worse just think about it he paid zero at least for about 20 years we believe now based on what we know and he advocating for huge tax cuts that would help him and his family even more what he want us to do pay him to lose money really\n\nthere a lot more to this story and were just slowly getting it into the public eye so we know he stiffed people didnt pay his bills we know he took bankruptcy depending on how you count four or six times you know that he paid no taxes for probably 20 years we dont know what his taxes would be after that he always talked about how he cant release his taxes because he under audit but he admitted everything before 2009 is not under audit so donald release everything up until 2009 show the american people your taxes\n\nill tell you another thing if im fortunate enough to be president were going to pass a law requiring anybody who is a nominee of a major national party to have to release their taxes\n\nso what did we find out today well a story just came out saying that donald trump used chinese steel and aluminum for two out of the last three construction projects so instead of buying his steel and aluminum from american plants here in ohio and pennsylvania instead of supporting hardworking families and american jobs he once again stiffed us he sent that money overseas\n\nnow he spends a lot of time bashing the chinese right you hear that all the time when he talks well it turns out he bought his steel and aluminum from the chinese it turns out he owes big money to the chinese so this is another one of the episodes of his reality television show where he is saying one thing and doing something else\n\nnow for years china has been undermining american businesses and workers by illegally dumping cheap aluminum and steel into our markets you know that right and it sounds like donald trump has been buying that dumped steel and aluminum how can he make america great again when he wont even buy american products in our country\n\nand ill tell you this is personal to me because as a senator i went before the international trade commission on behalf of steel workers in new york who i represented and as secretary of state i went toetotoe with the chinese i have put forward an agenda to crack down on trade abuses from countries like china to stand up for american workers and to rebuild american infrastructure with american materials like steel and aluminum\n\nand today in toledo i pointed out because chrysler just announced an expansion of the plant there for the new jeep wrangler  about 700 more jobs right i pointed out when the automobile industry was flat on its back and 850000 workers in ohio could have been absolutely out of a job  more than we can even imagine in terms of the longlasting impact on the economy here  donald trump said he didnt care save it dont save it didnt matter to him\n\nwell ill tell you where i stood i stood in favor of saving the american automobile industry and look what we got last year our auto industry had the best year theyve had in a really long time and so weve got to keep building it weve got to keep making sure that there are good jobs and weve got to protect good union jobs against the kind of assault that is coming from all sides\n\nso now i know that ohio is a tough tough state youve got to get out there youve got to talk to people answer questions make your case that what weve been doing that what were going to do all the way to the end of this election but i need your help to talk to anybody you know here who thinks they might be voting for trump i know you know people i know you do and youve got to stage an intervention youve got to sit them down and point out how everything he says he wants to do is absolutely opposite of what he has done and how everything he has proposed will help people like him and his family but not the vast majority of families in ohio in fact if you look at his tax proposals they benefit him and other wealthy people  hedge fund managers and the like and they would actually raise taxes on middleclass families\n\nnow that the kind of contrast were getting out in the campaign but that why we need your help  to make sure you go out and talk to everybody and i know people want change that part of the american dynamic spirit we want change well ill tell you one thing that is certain is well have change  it just what kind of change it whether or not we have change that helps the vast majority of americans hardworking americans middleclass families or continues to only help those at the top i want an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top and that exactly what were going to fight for and that is what were going to get\n\nill tell you ive been called a lot of things right ive never been called quitter if i tell you im going to get up every day and fight for you that is exactly what i will do\n\nbut i know i cant do it  i cant do it alone donald trump stood on the stage of his convention and just once again painted this dark and dire picture of america and then he said i alone can fix it he gets confused between leadership and dictatorship he has a hard time remembering who our friends are and who our adversaries are he has a weird fascination with dictators like vladimir putin we have a lot of people living in this part of ohio who either themselves or their parents or grandparents came from countries that were under the yoke of oppression and were never going to let that happen again\n\nand so when trump basically signs up for putin wish list that bad enough but then when he cavalier  and im not talking about basketball  when he is cavalier about nuclear weapons saying that oh he doesnt care if other countries get them in fact you know if there were a nuclear war in east asia if japan got nuclear weapons if south korea got nuclear weapons hey just go at it folks he even said he wouldnt care if saudi arabia got nuclear weapons one thing that has been a bedrock of american foreign policy through democratic and republican presidents going back to the dawn of the atomic age is we were committed to trying to keep other countries from getting access to nuclear weapons to be able to stop proliferation and now it even more important because it not only states that we have to worry about like north korea weve got to worry about terrorists getting their hands on nuclear weapons the last thing we want to do is just act like it doesnt matter because it does\n\ni was involved in putting together the sanctions against iran that drove them to the negotiating table and what i learned  if you use diplomacy and youre tough about it you can actually get an agreement that put a lid on their nuclear program and were going to make sure they follow it to the period the comma everything in that agreement im going to enforce and we still have challenges with iran but i think were in a stronger position given the fact that they are not racing for a nuclear weapon because we have intrusive inspections\n\nso i know diplomacy can work because ive done it and i know that  we can defeat isis and the terrorists if we work with other nations if we have a coalition that actually takes them out from the air takes them out on the ground and fights them online where they are doing so much damage by radicalizing and recruiting young people ive been laying out my plan for what i think it will take to defeat isis and i have no doubt we will and donald says he has a secret plan that he wont tell us about well there no secret he has no plan\n\nand weve got to do more  weve got to do more to make sure we protect our country we need the best intelligence we can get the best cooperation among law enforcement at all levels of government i will not rest as a former senator from new york on 9/11 i take this as a personal responsibility i will do everything i can to keep our country safe and to work with others to defeat the threat posed by terrorism\n\nand finally my friends weve got to bring our country back together there is too much divisiveness too much fingerpointing and scapegoating our diversity is one of our strengths we have to listen to each other we dont have to agree that is not required but we need to be respectful we need to listen and then we need to roll up our sleeves and get to work\n\nwhen i was first lady senator secretary of state i worked to find common ground with everybody i worked when i was first lady with republicans and democrats to create the children health insurance program that insures eight million kids when i was in the senate i worked with practically every republican i served with and they all have nice things to say about me when im not running for something and i will work again to move our country forward and to change the  of that and we had to get 13 republicans and i worked tirelessly and we got them we did that there is a lot we can do if we start listening and respecting each other and avoid the kind of namecalling and insults that we see too much of\n\nso im excited about the campaign but im even more excited about getting to work for you  being able to get up every day and find a way to try to help somebody i mean that is how i was raised in my church and by my family and that is what i have done through my advocacy work and my legal work on behalf of people who needed a voice and i will do everything possible to make sure i deliver results for you and the reason that i have published a book with my great running mate tim kaine  it right here  is real simple i want you to know what we say were going to do because i want you to hold me accountable i dont believe in bait and switch where i say oh were going to do something and then i really am over here doing something else that kind of reminds you of somebody doesnt it no here what were going to try to do were going to pay for it by raising taxes on the wealthy and closing loopholes on corporations and i am the only candidate who ran this whole campaign saying i will never raise taxes on the middle class that is not going to happen when i am president\n\nso please join this campaign in the last 36 days talk to your friends remember friends dont let friends vote for trump i am motivated every day because now im a grandmother  two beautiful grandchildren  and i think about their future i think about their lives i think about our country i want our country to be the land of opportunity the place where dreams do come true if youre willing to work for them not just for my grandchildren but for every child i want every child in this country to have a chance to live up to his or her godgiven potential and if you will help me win this election and then help me work to make it come true we will have a country that delivers on our dreams and a future we can all be proud of\n\nthank you and god bless you!
9,this is the day the lord has made let us rejoice and be glad in it!\ni am so  the world outside challenged the faith that comes from belief in here in this magnificent house of worship we pray for peace when there is too much violence outside of these walls in here we are called to confront injustice even when the world out there fails to see it in here we see the world as it is but we pray for the strength and wisdom to build the world as it should be\n\nit has been 12 days since mr scott was shot and killed twelve days since his wife rakeiya scott watched her husband die and seven children lost their father now we dont yet know all the details about the shooting but we do know this family and this community is in pain and therefore we pray for them and we pray for all families who have suffered similar losses but we do more than pray as ms bradford said we do what each of us can do not everyone can march but everyone can talk and everyone can reach out and everyone can vote\n\ntoo many african american families have been in the same tragic situation that the scott family has found themselves in fact the day before mr scott died another father terence crutcher was killed in a police encounter in tulsa oklahoma and there have been many others so many fathers and sons and even mothers and daughters who have died either after encounters with the police or at the hands of civilians with guns while they were doing things that were ordinary everyday activities walking home from the store with iced tea and skittles listening to music in their car with friends\n\nand we also know  and we must not forget  that violence has touched the families of police officers men and women who put on the uniform and put their lives on the line to protect others from dallas to baton rouge to philadelphia the families of fallen officers have also been dealt a great blow and they deserve our prayers as well\n\nit been a hard year hasnt it think about how many times president obama has had to console our nation about another senseless tragedy another shattered family another distressed community and our children are watching and they feel it too youve seen that right here in charlotte last monday at the city council meeting 10yearold taje gaddy said i wake up every morning scared that i wont get to grow up because i am black\n\na nineyearold zianna oliphant who here with us today along with her brother marquis and her family also spoke at that city council meeting with tears pouring down her face and when i read what she had said i had tears in my eyes too she said we are black people and we shouldnt have to feel like this it a shame that our fathers and mothers are killed and we cant even see them anymore it a shame that we have to go to their graveyard and bury them we need our fathers and mothers to be by our side what courage and clarity that young lady showed to the world\n\nbut can you imagine nine years old she should be thinking about happy adventures dreaming about all the wonderful things her future holds for her instead she talking about graveyards our entire country should take a moment to really look at what going on here and across america to imagine what we see on the news and what we hear about imagine through our children eyes\n\nim a grandmother and like every grandmother i worry about the safety and security of my grandchildren but my worries are not the same as black grandmothers they have different and deeper fears about the world that their grandchildren face it makes my heart ache when kids like zianna are going through this and trying to make sense of the absolutely senseless i know how i would feel i wouldnt be able to stand it if my grandchildren had to be scared and worried the way too many children across our country feel right now but because my grandchildren are white because they are the grandchildren of a former president and secretary of state let be honest here  they wont face the kind of fear that we heard from the young children testifying before the city council\n\nyou know every child deserves the same sense of security every child deserves the same hope they should not be facing fear they should be learning and growing imagining who they can be and what their contributions to our country could be as well weve got to take action weve got to start now not tomorrow not next year now we know we cant solve all these problems over night which means we dont have a moment to lose\n\nproverbs tells us where there is no vision the people perish so let hold on to a common vision let come together to make america a place where every child no matter who they are where theyre born or what they look like has the chance to live up to their godgiven potential\n\nbeing stronger together with this common vision means rejecting those forces that try to pit us against each other we can acknowledge that implicit bias still exists not just in police departments but throughout our country without vilifying police officers we can call for reforms to policing while still appreciating the many courageous and admirable officers out there who are doing their jobs with honor and integrity\n\ni think about an officer named montrell jackson you might not have heard of him but i want you to he was one of the officers murdered in baton rouge a few days before he died he wrote on facebook he was black but he wore blue in uniform he wrote i get nasty hateful looks out of uniform some consider me a threat these are trying times please dont let hate infect your heart and then he closed by saying that if anyone saw him on patrol and wanted a hug i got you\n\nmontrell jackson knew that making our communities safer and juster are not conflicting ideas and most officers will tell you they cant do one without the other i believe we need endtoend reform in our criminal justice system not half measures but full measures with real followthrough in america everyone should be respected by the law and have respect for the law\n\nthat starts with being honest being unafraid to face the facts face the fact that black men are far more likely to be stopped searched by police charged with crimes and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men for doing the same thing we need to fix a system where too many black parents are taken from their kids and imprisoned for minor offenses we need to make sure our police officers are trained in deescalating tense situations we need to dismantle the socalled schooltoprison pipeline and instead invest in education from early childhood through high school into higher education and yes we have got to fight for common sense reforms to stop the epidemic of gun violence in our communities\n\ngun violence is by far the leading cause of death for young black men more than the next nine causes combined weve got to make sure there are good jobs equality affordable housing in every zip code in america we need to make investments in communities that have been left out and left behind i am a strong supporter of congressman jim clyburn plan to put 10 percent of our federal funds into 20 percent of the communities that have generational poverty for 30 years or more\n\nnow there are some out there who see this as a moment to command the flames of resentment and division who want to exploit people fears even though it means tearing our nation even further apart they say that all of our problems will be solved simply by more law and order as if the systemic racism plaguing our country doesnt exist now of course we need safe neighborhoods no one is against that of course we need communities that are free from the epidemic of gun violence of course we need that but we also need justice and dignity and equality and we can have both this is not an eitheror question for america\n\ni want us to commit ourselves to this common vision that is where i will build on the work that president obama has done and i will be sure that this is not just about a campaign or an election this is much bigger than an election these are issues ive been fighting for since i was a young lawyer working for the children defense fund going to south carolina to try to get young teenagers 13 14yearolds out of jails with adult offenders i care deeply about this because it not just personal to so many of us it about the kind of country you want to be and the future we want for all of our children and grandchildren i think about that every time i see my grandchildren or every time i see a bright energetic impressive young woman like zianna come up here a minute would you\n\ni love your dress\n\nyou know god loves us all right we are called to care for and cherish each other it not easy it is not but that is our mission and that is what we are called to do not only as christians but as americans as human beings to understand and respect each other to fight for each other children each other dignity each other opportunity as if they were our own now make no mistake this is not easy work youve been doing this since adam and eve came here but it is righteous work protecting all of god children is america calling remember what scripture also tells us let us not become weary in doing good for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up we will not grow weary and we will not lose heart we will get up every single day have faith in one another and in our future and work for that better day for all of god people thank you
10,thank you so much! wow it is great to be back in cincinnati what a beautiful night on the banks of this magnificent river i am grateful to all of you i am thrilled to be here with my dear friends mark and gabby and with all of you because there are just eight days left in what is the most important election of our lifetimes\nare you ready to work hard in this election and win it are you ready to send ted strickland to the united states senate i\ve known ted a long time he is a champion for workers and families he knows that ohio needs more good jobs with rising wages and he is the kind of person who will actually work to get things done breaking through the gridlock in washington and this is important unlike his opponent ted strickland has never been afraid to stand up to donald trump\n\ni also want to thank mayor john cranley and state representative alicia reece and all the other elected officials including my friend the secretary of state alison lundergan grimes from across the river in kentucky and we are so fortunate to have two other champions for american families with us today i am awed by the courage and commitment that both mark and gabby bring to their work to do everything they can to help save lives in america\n\nyou know as gabby says every day when she goes out fight fight fight and fight she does she fights to make sure that we save lives and we prevent injuries and we do it together  to end the epidemic of gun violence that threatens our children our fellow men and women our country and gabby and mark know something very important there is a big majority of americans including a majority of gun owners to stand behind and achieve commonsense gun safety measures and i am looking forward to working with them as their partner\n\nyou know you go through life you go through the campaigns there are ups and there are downs and my mother who had a really difficult life she told me something that has stayed with me and certainly has come in handy in this campaign everybody gets knocked down what matters is whether you get back up and throughout this campaign i have stayed focused on one thing you  your lives your families the problems that keep you up at night because that\ really what this election is all about it\ not about the noise and the distractions it\ about what kind of country we want for our kids and what kind of president can help get us there\n\ni have so much that i want to do with you on behalf of cincinnati and ohio and america and whether or not i get the chance to serve you really depends upon what happens in this election\n\nnow earlier today i was up at kent state a great university and i told them about some of the reasons why i think it\ really important to get everybody out to vote in this election but i started by saying that there\ this new email story about  why in the world the fbi would decide to jump into an election without evidence of any wrongdoing with just days to go that\ a really good question but i want you to know  look i\ve said repeatedly i made a mistake i\m not making any excuses but i will tell you this if they want to look at some more emails of one of my staffers by all means go ahead look at them and i know they will reach the same conclusion they reached when they looked at my emails last year right it wasn\t even a close call and i think most people have moved on they\re looking and focused on okay who is going to be the next president and commanderinchief\n\ndid any of you see the debates any of you see the debates well i am  i got a little bit of a chance i did stand there for four and a half hours with donald trump proving conclusively i have the stamina to do the job but i did occasionally get a chance to ask people to take a look at my 30 years of public service my plans for our country what tim kaine and i have said we want to do and then weigh that against my opponent what he\ done and said i am running against someone who says he doesn\t understand why we can\t use nuclear weapons he actually said then why are we making them he wants more countries to have nuclear weapons he\ mentioned japan south korea even saudi arabia now if you are hoping that he might surround himself with good people who would stop his crazy ideas remember this when he was asked who he consults with on foreign policy donald trump said he didn\t need to consult because and i quote i have a very good brain he said he knows more about isis than our generals do  no donald you don\t and of course the people that donald trump has around him include two men whose activities are also reportedly being investigated because of their ties to russia vladimir putin and their allies\n\nso in these last days let\ not get distracted from the real choice in this election donald trump has proven himself to be temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president and commanderinchief\n\ni have to tell you it does not give me any pleasure saying that it\ not a small thing i have watched and known a lot of the people who have run for president both republicans and democrats and look i\ve had my disagreements with republicans i might have disagreed on policies or principles but i never doubted their fitness to serve in this office donald trump is different and that\ why there is so much at stake in this election he has a dark and divisive vision for america that could tear our country apart abraham lincoln understood a house divided against itself cannot stand and that was over the greatest of challenges  the challenge posed by slavery  and we fought a civil war but we also have to take stock of how divided we are today the kinds of divisions that need to be healed to bring people together\n\ni will tell you this i want to bring not just democrats but republicans and independents people who vote for me and people who vote against me together because i have a very different vision of america instead of dark and divisive it\ hopeful and inclusive it\ bighearted not smallminded it is about lifting people up not putting them down it\ a vision that says and i believe this with all my heart we are stronger together and america is great because america is good never forget that yes we have our flaws of course we\re only humans but what we have done over the course of our history to keep widening the circle of opportunity and equality and freedom is unlike any other place in the history of the world so we want an america where women are respected  where our veterans are honored  where parents and families are supported and workers are paid fairly and we believe in an america where marriage is a right and discrimination is wrong an america that leads in the world and lives up to our values where everyone counts everyone has a place and the american dream is big enough for everybody so the choice could not be clearer and the stakes could not be higher\n\nwhen i was at kent state talking about the threats that donald trump poses to our national security i was really struck it was a very big crowd and it was primarily students and i thought to myself well i\m not going to give a rahrah speech because i really want to talk about what this means to national security and i was introduced by a gentleman named bruce blair a former air force officer in charge of the nuclear codes and keys a launch officer and he came out for me along with now more than 30 launch officers and basically they said we cannot support donald trump because he should never ever be near the nuclear codes and keys\n\nand even the prospect of an actual nuclear war doesn\t seem to bother him good luck enjoy yourselves folks is what he had to say about a potential nuclear conflict in asia i wonder if he even knows that a single  a single  nuclear warhead can kill millions of people that is why dozens of retired nuclear launch officers took the unprecedented step of saying that donald should and i quote not have his finger on the button and when it comes to handling a crisis we\ve seen in this campaign that donald trump loses his cool at the slightest provocation  when he\ gotten a tough question from a reporter or when he\ challenged in a debate or when he sees a protestor at a rally when he\ confronted by his own words so imagine him in the oval office facing a real crisis  imagine him plunging us into a war because somebody got under his very thin skin i hope you\ll think about that when you cast your vote in this election think about what it takes to lead in a very complicated world and in whose hands you want to put the safety of our children and grandchildren\n\nand think about the difference between electing a president who will do nothing and president who will tackle the epidemic of gun violence in america as gabby knows so well 33000 americans a year are killed guns thousands more are injured it\ an average of 90 people a day dying here in ohio more people are killed by guns than die in car crashes we have seen moviegoers gunned down in theaters little children killed in their classrooms clubgoers massacred in orlando nine faithful people murdered at bible study in charleston south carolina and we\ve seen far too many young african american men and women killed by gun violence which is now the leading cause of death for young black men and when we think about that we think of dontre hamilton or jordan davis or trayvon martin and others i\ve had the great honor of getting to know their mothers who have turned their grief into action and their mourning into a movement\n\nbut here\ what i want to say if anything else in our country were killing as many people people of good faith people who believe like we do in the second amendment people who own guns people who go hunting people who are collectors we would say hey wait a minute this can\t go on we need comprehensive background checks to close the gun show loophole close the online loophole and we know here in ohio a majority of gun owners support these commonsense steps to prevent gun violence because they know we can respect the second amendment and keep our kids and communities safe at the same time and we need to keep guns out of the hands suspected terrorists if you are too dangerous to fly you are too dangerous to buy a gun period\n\nand look there is a very clear difference donald trump won\t stand up to the gun lobby he\ sold out to them in fact the gun lobby is spending more on ads to get donald trump elected than any other group more than 7 million in ohio alone and in return donald trump has promised to repeat president obama\ actions to strengthen criminal background checks donald says guns should be allowed in nightclubs that serve alcohol he\ even said on his very first day in office he would require every school in america to let people carry guns into our classrooms how can anyone think our schools would be safer with more guns\n\nso i have stood up to the gun lobby for years which is why they are running all of these ads against me and i will stand up to them as president i will work with gabby and mark and americans for responsible solutions to pass common sense reforms because we\ve got to keep guns out of the wrong hands and help save lives\n\ni will also get up every day in the white house working my heart out for you whatever i can do to knock down barriers to empower people to get the economy working for everybody not just those at the top that\ how i was raised i was raised to believe that if you work hard  and i believe in hard work  you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead in america and i will never ever quit on you when i tell you i\m going to try to do something that will make a positive difference in your life i don\t care what the political or other barriers are we\re going to find a way over under around or through until we get it done i\ve been fighting for families and underdogs my entire life and i\m not stopping now remember when our opponents go low we go high we\re not going to be distracted we\re not going to be knocked off course we know how much this election matters and everything all of you can do between now and the time that the polls close is going to really count\n\nnow the donald trump campaign strategy is pretty simple they\ve announced it their strategy is get women to stay home get young people to stay home and get people of color to stay home it\ all part of his scorchedearth campaign but it actually adds up to more than half of our whole population when you stop to think about it and it goes against everything we stand for so if you\re as upset as i am by the campaign that he has run the things he has said insulting not just women but immigrants latinos african americans prisoners of war muslims veterans the military  i mean the list goes on and on it\ almost impossible to understand how somebody could run for president who seems not to like america as much as he does\n\nso you know the best way to stop him by showing up with the biggest turnout in history we need more americans to vote and i think we have a chance to get more americans from all walks of life to vote because we\re already seeing record turnout twentythree million people have already voted in this election and more than one million of them are right here in ohio there is no doubt if we vote we win so please if you haven\t voted early please do so and please get your friends and your family everybody you know to vote take people to vote with you try to help those who might have a little problem getting there\n\nmake sure that everybody you know understands early voting has begun and you can go to iwillvotecom to find your nearest early voting location because make no mistake whatever issue you care about  i\ve only mentioned a few tonight but whatever issue you care about is on the ballot now it may be my name and my opponent\ name but where we stand on these issues what we\ve done in the past what we have said we want to do in the future that is all on the ballot the future of our economy is at stake of our education system is at stake fighting climate change and clean renewableenergy jobs are at stake lgbt equality is at stake equal pay for women is at stake actually in the end the american dream itself is at stake so i want you to think about how you will feel on november 9th\n\nhappy i think that\ the right answer but just suppose just suppose you go to bed early suppose you go to bed early maybe you were too busy to vote or maybe you didn\t make calls or knock on doors i want you to imagine so you get up early on the morning of the 9th and you log on to the news to find out hey what\ going on or maybe you turn on the tv or the radio and you hear\n\ni want you to really understand what that means for you and for all of us because i prefer for us to be motivated by what we\re for not what we\re against but i also think it\ prudent to imagine what could happen if we don\t do our part and when in the future somebody asks you maybe your kids or your grandkids \what did you do when everything was on the line\ i want you to be able to say \i voted for a better fairer stronger america\\n\nlet\ go out and in these next eight days do everything we can to make it clear we\re going after the kind of future that includes everybody we\re going to build this economy new jobs rising wages we\re going to make college affordable and help you pay down your student debt we are going to do what will give you the best chance for your own lives and the lives of our kids and our grandkids so if we build that future together we will be able to say we were part of making sure that america\ best days are still ahead of us and we will prove once and for all that love trumps hate\n\nthank you all
11,hello cleveland wow there is nothing like being introduced by congresswoman marcia fudge to get everybody going\ni am so excited to be here what a time to be back in cleveland\n\nthe indians are going to the world series\n\nthat is after the cavs won the championship what a year for cleveland you really are believe land\n\nnow i for one am hoping for a great lakes series i spent a lot of days at wrigley field as a kid so that would be a dream come true for me to have cleveland and chicago in world series and for us to win ohio\n\ni want to thank all of the people who are here today because you\ve heard from some great great folks i want to thank governor ted strickland our candidate to the united states senate i\ll tell you we could really use a democratic senate to get things done for the people of ohio and america\n\ni wanna thank mayor frank jackson county executive armond budish i wanna thank my great friend from youngstown congressman tim ryan\n\nand we need you all in we need you all in you\re rallying together and we need to rally together because you know i really believe we are stronger together!\n\nanybody watch the debate wednesday night well that was the third and last time that i will ever have to debate donald trump\n\ni have now spent four and a half hours on stage with donald proving once again i have the stamina to be president and commander in chief\n\nreally you  you just have to be a good cheer when you find yourself in situations like that\n\nand because i love this country and i believe in the american people i could feel so clear in my own mind and my heart about what we can do together so no matter what he was saying i just kept thinking of all the people that i have met throughout this campaign and i had the chance to talk about some of the most important concerns on people\ minds what keeps you up at night and as i said then and as i have said continuously we\re going to invest in the middle class\n\nwe\re going to invest in you and your families we\re going to make sure we produce enough good jobs with rising incomes that every single person especially every single young american here today will have the chance to go as far as your talents and your hard work will take you\n\nand we\re also going to protect our children from gun violence we are not going to tolerate the kind of gun violence epidemic that has swept this country and results in the deaths of 33000 people a year we can come together to meet our challenges no matter what they are\n\nbut on wednesday night donald trump did something no other presidential nominee has ever done he refused to say that he would respect the results of this election\n\nnow make no mistake by doing that he is threatening our democracy\n\nhe is basically saying hey we\ve been around 240 years and we\ve always had peaceful transitions no matter who won or who lost look if you lose an election  i\ve lost elections you don\t feel very good the next day do you\n\nbut we know in our country the difference between leadership and dictatorship right\n\nand the peaceful transition  the peaceful transition of power is one of the things that sets us apart it\ how we hold our country together no matter who\ in charge you know i went to 112 countries as your secretary of state and i  i saw the difference between what we do and what others do i was in countries where people jail their political opponents or execute them or exile them or invalidate elections that they didn\t win\n\nthat can never be allowed to happen here i believe that\ true no matter who you support in this election whether or not you support me or you support my opponent together we must support american democracy and the country that has given every one of us so many opportunities\n\nand the best way to do that my friends is to turn out and vote\n\n\n\nthose are great that is great i\m excited because we are well on our way there is an inspiring story being written right now by people across america and many of you are getting involved in this election some of you for the first time in your lives we now have in america more than 200 million registered voters\n\nthat is more than we have ever had in our entire history and that is really good news for our democracy more than 50 million millennials have registered\n\nyou know what that means young people will determine the outcome of this election which i think is good news that means our future is in good hands\n\nand listen to this because this is really exciting more than 4 million people have already voted\n\nincluding many people right here in ohio\n\nin fact in the first four days of inperson early voting here in ohio more people showed up to vote than they did at the same time in 2012 in our last election\n\nthat is fantastic and it shows how serious people are taking this election so numbers like that remind us that no matter all the negativity that\ out there there is something really exciting happening right now people are coming together democrats republicans independents all of us to reject hate and division\n\npeople are motivated to vote early to defend core american values to embrace a future where every person counts everyone has a place and everyone can contribute that is my vision i have a hopeful optimistic unifying vision for what our country will be because from the beginning our campaign has been focused on ideas not insults on bringing people together not tearing us apart\n\nand i want all of you to know that that is true not only for the campaign but if i am fortunate enough to be your president i want you to know and i want you to tell anybody you know any friends or colleagues at school or work or your neighborhood who may be planning to support the other guy here is what i want you to tell them\n\ni want you to tell them that i want to be their president i want to be every single american\ president whether you agree or disagree whether you vote for me or against me\n\ni believe we can disagree without being disagreeable i believe that and i have seen that happen i want to be a good listener i know there are a lot of people here in ohio who are discouraged frustrated even angry about what is going on in their lives about losing jobs they are upset about what they see happening around them i get that\n\nbut i think anger is not a plan we need plans that will help us deal with the legitimate concerns and questions that people have here in ohio i think that is what the country needs now and that is what i will try to offer\n\n i am not going to pretend that we can just snap our fingers and solve our problems that would not be fair it wouldn\t be true but i know we can make progress together and you deserve something to vote for not just against\n\nso i want to speak directly to the challenges that a lot of people here in ohio face especially when it comes to our economy you see i believe really simply that when the middle class thrives america thrives when we build the economy from the middle out and the ground up not from the top down we are more likely to provide better lives better incomes better opportunities for more americans\n\nmy opponent has a different perspective he really believes if you give trillions that\ with a t trillions in tax cuts to the wealthy to millionaires and billionaires and corporations everything will work out it\ really trickle down on steroids i believe differently that we must invest in working families in the middle class in small businesses that will power the economy\n\nand that\ what we\re going to do we\re going to get the economy to work for everyone not just those at the top who have done pretty well over the last years now donald likes to say he\ on the side of american workers but his actions tell a different story he has been buying cheap chinese steel and aluminum for his construction projects when he should be buying good american made steel that supports good american jobs\n\nand this is a very important issue here in ohio because you\re one of the largest steel producing states in america so you understand how important this is to support the american steel industry so i\m going to let donald try to explain himself to the steel workers filing for unemployment he has put chinese steel workers to work not american steel workers and we\re going to change that\n\nand for all of his talk about putting america first he\ made his products in at least 12 other countries trump\ suits were made in mexico they could have been made in brooklyn ohio trump\ furniture is made in turkey and it could have been made in cleveland trump barware is made in slovenia instead of toledo so if he wants to make america great again why doesn\t he start by making things in america again\n\nand we also know that he hasn\t paid a dime in federal income tax for years\n\nhe says that makes him smart well i don\t know how smart you have to be to lose 1 billion in a year in the first place but what that means is everybody else here all of us have paid more in federal income taxes than a billionaire right and that means he\ contributed zero zero for our military or our vets zero for pell grants to help young people go to college zero for our highways or investing in clean energy or other ways to help us with new jobs for the future\n\nnow tim kaine and i we have a different view we want to make the biggest investment in new jobs since world war ii jobs in infrastructure and manufacturing clean energy technology and small business we are going to make america the clean energy superpower of the 21st century\n\nand i\ve set some big goals i want us to deploy a half a billion more solar panels by the end of my first term\n\nand enough clean energy to power every home within 10 years\n\nwe\re also going to strengthen education at every level starting with universal prekindergarten education\n\nand we want good schools with good teachers in every zip code so that every kid gets a world class education i want us to bring back technical education in high school i think it was a mistake when we took it out of our high schools\n\nand let\ remember it\ at community colleges like this that thousands and thousands of people in our country of all ages get such a good start\n\nand i\m going to make public colleges and universities tuition free for any families making less than 125000 a year\n\neducation should lift you up not hold you back and we\re going to help you we\re going to help you pay back and pay down your loans too many young people are burdened by those debts\n\nit\ going to be great to help you pay it back as a percentage of your income so you\re never on the hook for more than you can afford senator bernie sanders and i worked on this plan together\n\nit\ going to help save millions of people thousands of dollars and you can actually go to hillaryclintoncom/calculator to see how much money you and your family could save with our plan\n\ni also want to do more for apprenticeship programs i thank all the unions represented here for the great apprentice programs that you have in place thank you\n\ni want to support apprenticeship programs and skills trainings with business and labor unions because there are going to be good jobs out there for welders and machinists and health technicians and computer coders and so much more i want everybody to have the chance to get your piece of the american dream and i think the american dream is big enough for everybody\n\nand we\re going to raise the national minimum wage because no one who works fulltime should still be in poverty\n\nas i said in the debate the other night i want to make sure that we take care of people on social security who were lowincome workers and women particularly widows who lose have of their monthly payment when their husbands die\n\nwe\ve got to do more to make sure social security provides a decent income for our seniors and yes don\t you think it\ finally time to guarantee equal pay for women\ work\n\nnow the equal pay issue is important in and of itself because if you\ve got a mother or a wife or a daughter or a sister who\ working you want her to be paid fairly i mean that\ good for the entire family right\n\nbut the equal pay issue gets at something even deeper we\ve got to make sure that women and girls are treated with the dignity and respect in our country that they deserve\n\nwe cannot  we cannot tolerate the kind of behavior and language we\ve seen from my opponent he thinks that belittling women makes him bigger goes after their dignity their selfworth and i don\t think there\ a woman anywhere who doesn\t know how that feels\n\nso we\re going to stand up for everybody men and women retirees the young millennials everybody deserves to be treated with respect and dignity\n\nand i have said repeatedly that we\re going to reform the criminal justice system so that it works fairly for everyone and we have to address systemic racism that is still too big a part of our lives together\n\ni want to give credit to all the young people and really people of all ages who\ve been marching and speaking out doing everything you can to make sure that issues of policing and mass incarceration environmental justice economic justice educational equity gun violence voting rights that they get the attention they deserve because it\ important that we lift these issues up and work to make sure that everybody in our country feels like they are seen and they are heard and all the advocates and activists who have challenged us to think about these issues of race and justice and equality and opportunity in new and powerful ways really deserve our appreciation\n\ni\m going to do everything i can to lift these issues up because one of my hopes for my presidency will be to root out systemic racism and bigotry and discrimination in whatever form it takes\n\nso really when you think about it my name will be on the ballot but it is not just me people say well she has lots of plans and all of that i do but i also have a lot of humility about this\n\ni really believe our country is at a turning point that this is a crossroads election so yes my name may be on the ballot but the question really is who are we as a country what are our values what kind of future do we want to create together\n\nit is so easy to get cynical about politics believe me i know that but this matters so deeply to our families and our communities and our country and indeed our world\n\nso i want to say something to people who may be reconsidering their support for my opponent i know you may still have questions for me i respect that i want to answer them i want to earn your vote\n\ni am reaching out to all americans democrats republicans and independents i think america needs every single one of us to bring our energy and our talents our ambition to build that better country\n\nso i hope that as we move through these next 18 days everyone thinks seriously about what you really want to see not just in your next president but in your lives in your jobs in your education in our future together\n\nand the only way we can have that positive optimistic unifying future is if all of you help us get there every phone call you make every door you knock on every voter you register makes a big difference\n\nso i hope you will give whatever time you can for these last days you can go to hillaryclintoncom and sign up to volunteer you can text join join to 47246 to join with your help we can elect democrats up and down the ballot starting with ted strickland and others who are running\n\nremember that early inperson voting in ohio began on october 12th and it ends on november 7th so you have more of a window to vote than a lot of people in other states\n\nand i hope you will exercise that and i hope that you will decide whatever issue you care about you can almost in your mind\ eye see that on the ballot see it next to my name see it whether you care about climate change and what we are doing to protect the great lakes including lake eerie while creating good paying clean energy jobs\n\nwhether you believe women should be able to make our own health care decisions\n\nif you believe marriage equality should be protected\n\nand that lgbt americans should be treated equally\n\nif you believe we should do more to stop the opioid epidemic that is destroying lives and communities\n\nthat we should do more to help with mental health and make sure that people get the treatment that they deserve\n\nif you believe we need to get the cost of health care premiums copays deductibles and prescription drug costs down\n\nif you believe that we should have a foreign policy where we work with our allies not insult them and achieve common goals toward peace and prosperity\n\nthis is our chance to send a very clear unmistakable message about what kind of country and future we want\n\nyou know i have two of the most wonderful grandchildren ever and i see them whenever i can i facetime with them all the time\n\nbut i think about them endlessly because i feel such a sense of responsibility not just because they\re my grandchildren obviously and i would do anything to help them but because i want everybody\ children and grandchildren to have the same opportunities to chart your own future to believe in yourself to contribute to this great america democracy of ours\n\nto be part on an economy that lifts you up not drags you down i am motivated by my work that i\ve done my entire life on behalf of kids and families\n\nfrom the time i joined the children\ defense fund until today and i will do whatever i can to make it my mission to give every single person especially every child and young person the chance to live up to your godgiven potential\n\nlet\ go out and prove that love trumps hate thank you!
12,hello broward county!whoa it is so great to be back in florida there are just 14 days two weeks from today\nthe most important election in our lifetimes i\m so grateful to see all of you and i want to thank the elected officials who are here congresswoman debbie wassermanschult\n\ncongressman alcee hastings congressman ted deutch commissioner mark bogen and others who are here along with senator bill nelson\ wonderful wife grace nelson so we are glad you are all here with me\n\nand i got to tell you i was thrilled to be introduced by the person i hope will be the next senator from the great state of florida congressman patrick murphyyou know i think patrick is exactly the kind of senator that florida needs and deserves because he will help us break through gridlock and create more good jobs with rising incomes and patrick knows we have to build an economy from the middle out and the bottom up not from the top down\n\ni also appreciate the fact that we now are seeing an emerging bipartisan consensus that we need to fix our broken criminal justice system do you agree but it\ going to take strong and committed leaders like patrick murphy who are ready to show up and fight hard and work to get this done and  and this is important my friends unlike his opponent patrick murphy has never been afraid to stand up to donald trump\n\ni think florida deserves a senator who\ going to fight for comprehensive immigration reform that will keep families together against a deportation force\n\nthis is what is so unimaginable of law enforcement officials to go door to door house to house business to business school to school rounding up 11 million people i think that is so wrong and it is not going to happen in america so you deserve also a senator who actually believes climate change is real as opposed to someone who every time he\ asked says well i\m not a scientist and i always wonder why don\t you talk to a scientist like start here at broward college you could talk to scientists\n\nand you deserve a senator who would never say that social security and medicare have and this is a quote weakened us as a people\n\nhis solution patrick\ opponent\ solution is to privatize medicare\n\n boo!\n\n that is exactly the right response but don\t boo vote right\n\nand you deserve a senator who would never support cutting 360 million from florida\ schools because patrick knows every child in florida deserves a worldclass education so my friends patrick murphy is a smart toughminded legislator and an independent voice\n\nthat\ what we need more of in washington people like patrick who are going to get up every day and go to work for you a better life for you and your families instead of blocking progress at every turn listening to the special interests and powerful forces that really are not interested in what it\ going to take for every one of you to get ahead and stay ahead\n\nso please when you get out and vote please remember you can send patrick murphy to the united states senate and you will be glad you did\n\nnow i know there\ an overflow crowd outside and i\m so sorry they can\t be in but i\m told that they can hear us and maybe even see us and i want to thank them for coming as well\n\ni got to ask you did anybody see the last debate\n\nwell the good news  the good news was it was the last debate\n\n happy birthday to you!\n\n well thank you!\n\nthank you yeah you know you\re right that last debate was like an early birthday present right but here\ what i wanted you to remember i stood next to donald trump for four and a half hours proving once again i have the stamina to be president and commander inchief\n\nyou know i tried as much as i could to talk about all issues that are on your minds that i believe we can work together to improve and in fact my wonderful running mate i senator tim kaine wrote a book called stronger together and we put all of our policies in it because i want you to know what we\re going to try to do if we\re so fortunate enough to be the next president and vice president\n\nand i think it\ important because i want you to have confidence that we\re going to work every day to implement the plans that we have put forth and i tried in the debate to draw the contrasts with donald trump who doesn\t really have very many plans you know i\ve tried to run a campaign based on issues he\ run a campaign based on insults and so in the debate we didn\t have a lot to talk about other than he continued true to form to throw out his insults\n\nbut in that last debate he said something that i found horrifying well he said a lot of things cut there\ one thing in particular that i wanted to point out because no presidential candidate republican or democrat has ever said this he refused to say that he would respect the outcome the election\n\ni guess we shouldn\t be too surprised this is the same guy who said he thought the emmys were rigged against him but this is serious you know on january 20th the first thing a president does is to take an oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution and i have serious doubts about whether donald trump even understands what that means\n\nin america we don\t say we\re going to keep you in suspense about whether we will respect the outcome of an election we have free and fair elections and the peaceful transfer of power that is one thing that makes american great it makes america who we are\n\nand we don\t impose religious tests at our borders because we are a country that was founded on religious liberty and we don\t punish newspapers or journalists that try to cover the news or are critical of politicians or threaten to restrict the first amendment because our democracy depends on a free press and we don\t incite violence and turn people against each other we respect the open exchange of ideas that a democracy depends on\n\nyou know i\ve got to say i bet some of you or maybe your parents or your grandparents came from places where none of that was true right there is a reason why america is the greatest and longest lasting democracy the world has ever known because we believe that no matter what you look like or where your parents were born or who you love you have the right to be treated equally and fairly in the united states\n\nand donald trump is attacking everything that has set our country apart for 240 years now after spending his entire campaign attacking one group of americans after another  immigrants african americans latinos women pows muslims people with disabilities  now his final target is democracy itself so here\ what i want you to know in the four years we are going to change some things in america right\n\ni do want to get the economy working for everyone not just those at the top and we\re going to do that along with other positive changes but we are not going to change the fundamental values that made america the greatest nation in the history of the world\n\nyou know i think it all started  i think this all started when george washington refused to become a king right now donald trump probably would have called him a loser\n\ninstead that was one of the most important decisions any president has ever made eight years it\ time to move on we fought a revolution so that we would not have a king we would not be subjects we would be independent citizens i cherish that idea\n\nso here\ the good news americans are coming together at the very moment when donald trump is making an unprecedented attack on our democracy millions of people are registering voting early and volunteering in this campaign\n\nand here\ something very exciting we have reached a milestone more than 200 million americans are now registered and that includes 15 million young people the most ever in history\n\nand you know what more than six million people have already voted and more than one million of them are right here in florida\n\nso i think you only see numbers like this when people are standing up for what they really believe in and that includes not just democrats but republicans and independents coming together to reject hate and division and i am so excited about what that means\n\nbut the energy we are seeing across florida and america is not just because of what we are against it\ about what we\re for it really is it\ about fighting for that future where everyone counts everyone has a place and no one is left out or behind but i want you to know we still have a lot of work to do i feel good but boy i am not taking anything for granted i\m going to work as hard as i can between now and the close of the election that\ two weeks from today\n\nand you know it\ so important for florida there are so many issues that we need to remind people about last time i was here i campaigned with al gore and he said a lot about the climate crisis and you know why because we\re seeing the reality of climate change every day in florida we are seeing areas in miami even on sunny days without a drop of rain where the streets are flooding and the ocean is rising\n\nand what we\ve got to do is make sure that this issue  fighting climate change creating clean renewable energy jobs  stays at the top of the priorities and that\ why you need a new senator like patrick murphy\n\ni have to say nobody should want to wake up on november 9th and wonder whether there was more you could have done i hope you will wake up on november 9th proud that you took a stand and voted for an america that belongs to all of us where we set big goals and we work together to achieve them\n\ni got to tell you i believe america is great because america is good\n\nand i want to tell you one other thing i want to say one other thing that\ really very important to me we should honor the men and women in uniform who fight for our country\n\nthat\ why i was so appalled when donald trump tweeted that the new effort underway to push the terrorists out of the key city of mosul is already and i quote him a total disaster and that our country is again a quote looking dumb really he\ declaring defeat before the battle has even started he\ proving once again he is unqualified to be commander in chief of our military\n\nhere\ another example he was asked if he would defend our allies he said well first he\d want to know if they made any payments to us to defend them and when asked specifically about israel he said and i quote again he would love to be neutral\n\nnow we can\t have a president who says he\ neutral on monday proisrael on tuesday and who knows what on wednesday because in his mind everything is negotiable\n\ni have a different view we stand with our allies we stand with those who will help us defeat terrorism\n\nso i  i get pretty excited about what we could to together and with your help we\re going to make the biggest investment in new jobs since world war ii  jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing and clean renewable energy and small businesses i want us to make america the clean energy super power of the 21st century\n\nwe can create millions of jobs and protect our planet at the same time and i\ve got to say no state no state should care more about this issue than florida right and you know i\ll tell you something that it\ kind of sad to be honest with you i\ve traveled all over the country and in new jersey and massachusetts they have more solar power than the sunshine state\n\nwhy well because you have a governor and a legislature who like your current senator doesn\t want to believe the science of climate change doesn\t see the opportunity that florida has to be literally the global leader in clean energy\n\nand so i want to deploy a halfbillion more solar panels by the end of my first term and enough clean energy to power every home in america within 10 years\n\nand we\re also going to strengthen education at every level starting with universal prek and working  working with our teachers to make sure every child has a good school with good teachers in every zip code and here\ what i want all the students to hear we\re going to make college more affordable for everyone\n\nyou know after our primary which was hardfought and i was proud of the primary we ran because it was about issues senator sanders and i got together came up with a plan to make public colleges and universities tuitionfree for any families making less than 125000 a year\n\nthat\ the vast majority of families and if you\re over that we\re going to make it debtfree so pay what you can afford but i don\t want to see young people and their families going into debt i view this as an investment and that\ why we\re going to make it easier for you to afford to pay back your college debt  pay it down and pay it off\n\nand i also want more pathways to good jobs that don\t require a fouryear college degree let\ return technical education to high schools let\ do more with our community colleges let\ have more apprenticeship programs so that everybody has a chance at a good job\n\nand you know in addition  in addition to making the economy grow and making sure people are ready with the skills to do these jobs i want to make it fairer that\ why i want to raise the national minimum wage if you work fulltime you shouldn\t still be in poverty and don\t you think it is finally maybe past time to guarantee equal pay for women\ work\n\nand you know i always tell crowds this is not a women\ issue it\ a family issue if you have a wife a mother a sister or a daughter working it\ your issue and that\ why we have got to get this fixed once and for all\n\nand let\ make childcare affordable and let\ have more profit sharing and let\ do the kinds of things that will lift everybody up now you know when i talk about raising equal pay for women as one of my primary issues you know donald trump or somebody always says well there she goes playing the woman card and i\ve got to tell you i don\t believe that\ what it is i think we\re paying  playing the smart card\n\nbecause we want everybody\ incomes to go up that\ how we\re going to get this economy really moving forward creating new jobs and so if that\ playing the woman card you know what we say deal me in\n\ni\ve also said i will pledge not to do anything that would raise taxes on people making less than 250000 a year because we don\t need to do that we can go where the money is the millionaires and the billionaires the corporations to make them pay their fair share to support the kind of growth that we need in our economy\n\nwe\re going to close the loopholes and make sure no multi millionaire can get away with paying a lower rate than a nurse or a police officer or a teacher\n\nnow remember when we learned in one of the debates that donald trump hadn\t paid any federal taxes\n\nfor about 20 years is the best guess we\ve got and his excuse i love his excuse his excuse was well he lost 1 billion in a year\n\ni\ve been really pondering this how does anybody lose 1 billion in a year especially when you\re running casinos think about it has anybody here ever been to a casino\n\n yes!\n\n well you know usually they say the house wins so donald trump said it was smart for him to avoid paying taxes well if losing 1 billion is smart i think that\ kind of upside down and backwards i think people should be working hard to make their incomes to support their families and that\ what we\re going to do because we don\t want the kind of values that donald trump used in running his business to be in our government\n\nhe stiffs  he stiffs small businesses my dad was a small business owner donald trump has refused to pay all kinds of folks workers small businesses installing drapes or marble or glass or where he bought pianos he didn\t pay them he just doesn\t pay them and he gets away with it because he turns and he says to these small businesses well go ahead and sue me\n\nwell my dad because he was a small business man i know he could never have afforded that so i\m just glad he never got a contract from donald trump because our family would have been hurt by that\n\nso here\ the bottom line and here\ what i need you to do we have got to get everybody you know to turn out and vote and you have early voting now and it\ going to be much easier for some of you to vote early and if you believe in any of the issues that we have talked about in this campaign if you believe that women and girls should be treated with respect if you believe that marriage equality should be protected\n\nif you believe  if believe in science and believe we should take action if you believe america belongs to everybody willing to work for it and we should stand up against any kind of negative tax then i hope you will come out and vote because it\ going to be a close election pay no attention to the polls don\t get  don\t get complacent because we\ve got to turn people out\n\nso i\m asking you to vote for me i\m asking you to send patrick murphy to the senate i\m asking you most importantly to vote for yourselves because really that\ what is at stake so early voting began here in south florida yesterday it goes through sunday november 6th you can go to your early voting site in your county between 7 am and 7 pm in fact you can go across the street right now to the north regional library and cast your ballot today\n\nand we have volunteers and staff ready to escort you so hey go ahead and vote now and you can go to iwillvotecom to confirm your polling place and make sure you have a plan to vote but don\t stop there if you will join us in these next two weeks every phone call you make every door you knock on will make a difference so please go to hillaryclintoncom sign up to volunteer take out your phone text join to 47246 and get involved because the bigger the turnout the bigger statement we will make about the kind of country we are and the future we want to build together\n\nnow let me just end by saying that people ask me all the time you know what motivates you how do you do this day after day and you know look i love this country and i feel blessed i feel blessed and i want everybody to have the same chance to go after your part of the american dream and i think the american dream is big enough for everybody\n\ni think a lot about my two grandchildren because obviously i would do anything to help them but it\ not just them i want to help everybody\ children and grandchildren because the kind of country we will have when they become adults will be affected by the decisions we make now on education on healthcare on ending the epidemic of gun violence on getting the cost of prescription drugs down on preserving and protecting social security and medicare doing what we must to make sure we\re passing on a country that provides the same level of opportunity to all who come after us\n\nso please join me this is bigger than me it\ bigger than any of us it\ even bigger than donald trump if you can believe it\n\nthis is a crossroads election that\ going to determine so much about what kind of country we have in the decades ahead i want to wake up in the white house with your help making it my mission to do everything i can to give every person and particularly every child the chance to live up to his or her godgiven potential\n\nif you will stand with me if you will work with me over the next two weeks let\ go out and build the kind of future we want for ourselves for our kids and let\ prove once and for all that love trumps hate\n\nthank you all very much
13,it is a glorious night here at the university in columbus in the great state of ohio and i am thrilled to be here with all of you and i want to thank tony for his introduction he made the greatest case against my opponent didn\t he thank you tony and thanks to mayor ginther and congresswoman beatty and to my great friend your former governor and with your help the next senator ted strickland\nany of you see that debate last night i\ll tell you what i\m not sure you\ll ever see anything like that again at least i hope you won\t it was such a clear display of what\ at stake in this election and i am thrilled to have the chance to talk with all of you about what we can do together because i truly believe we are stronger together to move our country forward\n\nnow the one thing i thought about last night and said was as i was standing there on the stage with my opponent was to remember what michelle obama had said to paraphrase her one of us went low and one of us went high i want you to understand i want to be a president for all americans i think the american dream is big enough for everybody and i am honored to have support not just from democrats but from independents and republicans because we\ve got to pull this country together if we\re going to move into the future together creating what we need for ourselves and our children\n\nnow i got to tell you tomorrow is a big day in ohio for this election because tomorrow october 11th is the last day to register in ohio and i hope every one of you will take your phones out go to iwillvotecom to confirm that you are registered because we want everybody to vote and we particularly want young people to vote because this is your election more than anybody else\\n\nwhen i think about the challenges that we\re facing i don\t think any one person has all the answers i think we have to listen to each other and respect each other and celebrate our diversity because that makes us smarter as well as stronger\n\ndonald trump spent his time last night attacking me when he should have been apologizing we all heard on that tape what he thinks of women and how he treats women and last night he doubled down on his excuse saying that well it\ just locker room banter you know what\ happened today which is so interesting is that a lot of athletes and coaches from the nba from major league baseball from the nfl and more have been coming forward tweeting they\ve been saying no that\ not what happens in our locker rooms and i just happen to think that our athletes and our coaches know a lot more about what happens in locker rooms than donald trump does\n\nbut it wasn\t just this one video that was so disturbing even shocking we have seen this kind of behavior throughout this entire campaign and it\ not just about women yes he\ insulted and demeaned women we\ve seen it over and over again but he has targeted others as well he\ disrespected and denigrated african americans and latinos muslims and pows people with disabilities and immigrants he is an equalopportunity insulter if there ever was one\n\nthat is not what we are in america and it may be who he is but this election is our chance to show who we are we are better than that we are bigger than that and i want to send a message to every boy and girl every man and woman in our country indeed to the entire world that that is not who america is and we can do that by making sure that we turn out in the biggest numbers ever some analysts are saying we may have the biggest presidential election than we\ve had in a really long time and the main reason is because your generation the young people of america are the most tolerant open and generous generation in american history\n\nyou know what\ at stake but you also know what you believe and you don\t want someone who says that he\ going to appoint supreme court justices who will reverse marriage equality who will  who will keep citizens united one of the worst decisions ever made that allowed dark unaccountable money in our electoral system that will reverse a woman\ right to make her own health care decisions who will defund planned parenthood you know better than that you are helping us move toward a more perfect union that has been the story of america at our best we keep widening the circle of opportunity and inviting more people in if you\re willing to do your part you\re willing to make your contribution there is a place for you in this nation of ours\n\nwe don\t have to make america great we\ve got to do what we can to make sure it remains great and it becomes greater because we keep broadening that circle of opportunity\n\nand please never forget america is great because america is good and if we deviate if we deviate from our fundamental values  and that\ indeed the kind of campaign my opponent has run he has said he would order our men and women in uniform to commit war crimes he has said he would impose a religious test on who could come into our country  a nation founded on religious freedom and liberty this is turning the clock back not just a few years but centuries the only way to rebuke this is to vote use the single most important fundamental right you have as citizens of america\n\nand when you do i want you to know what you\re voting for because i don\t want you just to vote against something i want you to vote for something and here\ what we\re going to do\n\ni believe our economy should work for everyone not just those at the top so i am ending this campaign the way i started my career all those years ago when i went to work for the children\ defense fund as soon as i got out of law school i said i don\t want to do anything else other than work hard and advocate for kids and families so i was fortunate to have the chance to be really on the front lines of a lot of change helping to get the law that enabled people kids with disabilities to go to school now most of you may not have any reason to remember this because you weren\t born but  there was a time in our country not so long ago when if you had a disability if you lived in a school district there was no requirement that they make accommodations for you and literally millions of kids were denied an education i went door to door getting information about what was going on with these children so that i could contribute a report to a big national effort to go to the congress and say this is wrong  in america we\re better than this open the doors of our schools to kids with disabilities\n\nand then i was privileged to work to make sure that we got young people out of adult jails and prisons where they had no reason to be in the first place\n\nso when donald trump talks about what i\ve been doing for the last 30 years i welcome that i welcome it because in the 1970s i was working to end discrimination and he was being sued by the justice department for racial discrimination against people in his apartments and in the 1980s i was working to improve the schools in arkansas to make sure that teachers were well paid and that the coursework was going to prepare kids for the future while he was getting a loan for 14 million from his father to start a business and in the 1990s i went to the un conference on women and said women\ rights are human rights  while he was insulting miss universe alicia machado and on the day  on the day that i was in the situation room watching the raid that brought osama bin laden to justice he was hosting celebrity apprentice so if he wants to talk about what we have been doing the last 30 years bring it on\n\nso we\ve got to make up our minds about what kind of economy we want and i\m pretty clear about that i think we want new jobs with rising incomes and i want us to have the biggest new jobs effort since the end of world war ii and i have some specific ideas in mind we are going to have a big investment in infrastructure our roads our bridges our tunnels our ports our airports our water systems they need to be upgraded and maintained and built that is a question of competitiveness we have to have a competitive economy our airports are so rundown we don\t even have one airport in our entire country in the top 25 in the world because we\re not using the newest technology we\re not really prepared to do what we need to to invest in you and invest in those new jobs\n\ni do want to bring advanced manufacturing i heard ted strickland talking about that i think we can have a manufacturing renaissance there is no reason that we cannot own new manufacturing i\m not interested in a race to the bottom in competing for lowwage jobs i am interested in competing for the highwage jobs so let\ lead in precision machining 3d printing\n\nand let\ be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century some nation\ going to have that title i think it\ either going to be germany or china or us it should be us no question it should be we\re going to fight climate change and we\re going to lead the world in fulfilling the requirements of the paris agreement\n\ni\m running against somebody who doesn\t believe in climate change or at least he says he doesn\t  who has even said he thinks it\ a hoax created by the chinese well right now the chinese have twice as much renewable energy as we do so maybe they think it\ a hoax but they\re investing and they\re creating and they\re going to want to export and what a shame it would be we have innovated we have made the technology that could bring us into the forefront of this and we\re going to do it\n\nwhen i am president i want all of you who care about science technology engineering mathematics i want you to be part of it and while we are growing the economy we are going to make it fairer we are going to raise the national minimum wage because no one who works fulltime should be left in poverty and don\t you think it is finally time to guarantee equal pay for women\ work\n\nyou know back in the spring i was at a town hall in las vegas and the little girl raised her hand and i called on her and she said to me \if you\re elected president does a girl president make the same as a boy president\\n\ni said well that\ one of those jobs where they have to publish what you make so we\re going to have more transparency so people have more incentive to make sure that everybody is treated fairly\n\nand i\ll tell you something else i want to do more to promote profitsharing if you help to make the profits it shouldn\t all just go to the executives and the shareholders you should be able to share in that\n\nnow there\ a lot we can do and people say \well how are you going to pay for it\ well i\m going to go where the money is and all the money is going to the wealthiest in our country i have made a pledge and you can hold me to it i will not raise taxes on the middle class nobody who is working hard to get ahead should be asked to pay more in taxes when we have so many people who have done so well and are not paying their fair share\n\nnow donald trump is the poster child for this last night he finally admitted he hasn\t paid a dime in federal income tax for years now he claims that\ because back in the early 1990s he apparently lost a billion dollars running casinos who loses money running casinos really now one of his supporters said \well the fact that he lost a billion dollars and that meant he didn\t have to pay taxes made him a genius\ well i guess you do have to be a genius to lose a billion dollars in a year but i\ll tell you what what that meant was he paid zero zero for the military zero for our vets zero for pell grants to help a lot of you afford college and get through college\n\nand then he did something that in retrospect seemed both odd and not very smart he brought in warren buffett he said \well everybody does this warren buffett does this\\n\nso warren buffett who by the way is a real billionaire warren buffett heard that pretty hard to miss and so he put out a statement today and here\ what he said he said \i have paid federal income tax every year since 1944 when i was 13\ he said \i have copies of all 72 of my returns and none uses a carryforward\ that was the gimmick trump used to avoid paying his fair share and then warren buffett ends by saying \finally i have been audited by the irs multiple times and am currently being audited i have no problem releasing my tax information while under audit\ \neither would mr trump at least he would have no legal problem in doing so\ well if you take a shot at warren buffett you\d better be prepared\n\nand in fact warren buffett actually agrees with me that wealthy people ought to pay more he says no person in his fortunate position in life should be paying a lower tax rate than people who work for him and he has proposed what\ called the buffett rule and i am absolutely behind that and i\ve said that\ one of the changes i want  so that the wealthy have to pay their fair share\n\nnow there was a lot about last night that was hard to believe and so don\t but one of the things that really struck me was he had not answer you know he\ not usually tonguetied but he had no answer when confronted about the report that he\ been buying cheap chinese steel for his construction projects instead of americanmade steel that supports good american jobs now i know you\ve seen reports and you\ve probably seen a lot of the visuals coming out of his rallies he\ had a lot of them across ohio he claims to be on the side of workers he especially likes to talk about how he supports american steelworkers he even had the nerve  this is what kills me about him  he even had the nerve to brag about how american steel will send new skyscrapers soaring and the whole time he was hiding the truth hiding the fact that he chose to buy illegallydumped chinese steel instead of american steel\n\nyou know when china illegally floods our market with steel at belowprice and people like trump buy it that kills jobs it kills jobs in this state including right here in columbus this may columbus castings the biggest singlesite foundry in america just seven miles from where we are tonight filed for bankruptcy and announced that 800 workers would be laid off now when i think of that and i think of the way trump has been playing people it really  it really gets me upset there\ no justification for it but it fits him to a t for all his talk about putting america first he\ made his products in at least 12 other countries trump\ suits and ties were made in mexico and china they could have been made right here in ohio in fact he could have made his ties three miles from the trump tower in new york\n\nso we\ve got to figure out how we have an economy that really does produce growth and rewards companies that do the right thing and that for me means we need to have a tax system that rewards investment in our country investment in workers investment in plant and equipment investment in research and development and give the good guys a chance to get ahead instead of being taken advantage of by wall street and others\n\nwe are going to end the cowboy culture on wall street and what happens in too many boardrooms we\re going to defend the tough new rules on wall street that president obama got passed the doddfrank rules trump wants to do away with those he also wants to do away with the consumer financial protection bureau something that was designed and created by my friend senator elizabeth warren to protect consumers he wants to do away with that and yet he claims to be on the side of working people and the middle class\n\nwell we\re going to crack down on corporate fraud like we\ve seen at wells fargo we\re going to crack down to make sure that wall street can never wreck main street again and we\re going to do it in part by imposing some penalties on companies that try to pick up and leave america if they try to leave we\re going to slap an exit tax on them and make them pay back every single penny they ever got in tax benefits from anybody in america\n\nwe\re also going to end the carried interest loophole i\ve been trying to get that done for years we\re going to get it done we\ve got a couple of different ways of doing it i hope that congress along with us but if they don\t we\re going to figure out a way to finally put an end to what is one of the most unfair parts of the whole tax code hedge fund managers and others paying a lower tax rate not for investing but just for moving money around that\ going to end i want to reward the productive economy i don\t want to keep rewarding the financial economy that is not the way we\re going to grow new businesses and create new opportunities and more jobs for americans\n\nnow people in ohio often ask about \well what are we going to do about trade\ well we\re going to have smart and fair trade that\ what i love about your senator sherrod brown he is one of the best advocates for the kind of trade deals we should have look we\ve got to trade with the rest of the world we\re only 5 percent of the population of the world we\ve got to trade with the other 95 percent when i was secretary of state we really bore down on this and we increased american exports 30 percent and in particular 50 percent to china because we stood behind every american business we helped them knock down every barrier so that they could get into those markets and sell\n\nand i\ve gone toetotoe with the chinese over trade they have tried to slap unfair tariffs and prevent american companies from doing business without having to pay some kind of big fine or make some big deal so we\re going to stand up i\m going to have a trade prosecutor who will report directly to me to make sure every trade deal we\re already in is absolutely followed to the letter so nobody takes advantage of us\n\nand i\ve always had three tests for trade deals does it create american jobs does it raise american incomes is it good for our national security and when it comes to the transpacific partnership the tpp it fails my tests once it was finally negotiated i don\t think it will do what i want it to do so i oppose it i oppose tpp now i\ll oppose it after the election i\ll oppose it as president but i\m going to keep fighting to open markets so that we can get more jobs and rising incomes by exporting into those markets and doing business with the rest of the world\n\ni also saw a sign or a tshirt out here about social security and that may not always be something that people on a great university campus think about but i\ll tell you what i am never going to let anybody privatize social security that is off the table forever\n\nso let\ say yes to good jobs but here\ what else we need to say yes to let\ say yes to good education from preschool all the way through college and university i want every kid to be able to attend this great university to do well and for a lot of kids they\re not prepared when they get to kindergarten and first grade there\ an achievement gap already there\ also a digital gap we have five million homes mostly poor homes without access to the internet so they\re behind i want this to be a true meritocracy i\m tired of inequality i want people to feel like they can get ahead if they work for it\n\nso i want to have universal prekindergarten so every child can be prepared to be successful i want good schools and good teachers in every zip code so every child has the best possible public education and i think we made a mistake when we took what used to be called vocational education out of high school we need technical education for more young people not everybody needs to or wants to go to a fouryear college but everybody should have the opportunity to get the skills that he or she needs to get ahead and be successful i want us to have our community colleges working with our high schools and our businesses we have a lot of job openings for machinists and tool and die markers for coders for all kinds of skills\n\nand then when it comes to college i want everybody who goes to a public college or university to understand what i am proposing that is a joint proposal from senator sanders and myself we both remember that college was affordable and it isn\t for a lot of people now and a lot of states have disinvested in their great public colleges and universities so here is our proposal\n\nwe want anyone from a family that makes less than 125000 a year to go to ohio state university tuitionfree and for families over that line we want you to go debtfree so yes you pay what you can afford but you don\t have to go into debt to go to ohio state and i\ll tell you the other big problem  how many of you already have student debt oh wow practically every hand well here\ what we\re going to do we\re going to make it possible for you to refinance that debt if you can refinance your home mortgage your car payment or if donald can refinance his airplane you ought to be able to refinance your student debt\n\nand then we want you to pay it back as a percentage of the income you make and have a limit on that 10 percent so that  i feel personally about this because that\ what i did after law school my dad was a small businessman and he really was a saver he didn\t even have a credit card didn\t believe in that so he saved the money for me to go to college i had to work if i wanted to buy a book but that was okay that was the arrangement and then i told him i wanted to go to law school he said \you\re on your own i don\t have any money for that\ so i worked i got a small scholarship and i took out loans but boy was i lucky because i got into one of the earliest income repayment programs in other words when i got out of law school i could go to work for the children\ defense fund and make i don\t know 14000 a year because i could pay it back as a percentage of my income not on an interest rate of 8 10 12 percent like i see from young people across america\n\nso that\ what i want but i also want to make it possible if you do public service or national service to have a lot of your loan and maybe all of it forgiven because you\re going to be paying back to our country and i\ve got this idea about something i\m calling the national service reserve it\ kind of like if any of you have ever been in the military reserve you get the training and you\re kind of on call and you practice and train and then if you\re needed you\re called up i want a civilian national reserve and i want people of all ages in it and we would train you so that if there\ a natural disaster or some other problem that has to be dealt with we could call you up to go do that and it\ a way of making sure that people are giving back all the time to this country because that\ how we build solidarity that\ how we get to know each other better\n\nso i\m pretty excited about what we\re going to do together and i can\t do any of this without your help i really am asking you to do everything you can to make sure you\re registered to tell your friends and anybody else you can talk to make sure they\re registered as i said go to iwillvotecom you can find it out right there on that site and we\d love to have you be involved in the campaign because i know that if we win in november we can summon the positive spirit of our country back again i think i have to do everything everything in my power to bring people together and i will\n\nit\ really important to me that you know that i want to be your president whether you vote for me or not obviously i hope you do but i will be your president and i will stand up for you and i will work for you and i will fight for you so please if you\re not registered get registered by tomorrow and then you can start voting october 12th and whatever issue whatever issue you care about imagine that that is on the ballot imagine if you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage if you believe  if you believe that we finally should have paid family leave in this country like every other advanced economy if you believe climate change is real and we could save our planet by creating a lot of jobs at the same time if you believe diversity is america\ strength not a weakness if you believe women should be able to make our own health care decisions and that lgbt americans should be treated equally across america and you should be able to live up to your potential no matter who you are or where you come from then start voting october the 12th!\n\nand i promise

young americans so please join this campaign be part of it for the next 29 days and together we will prove that we can have the future that we want and that yes love trumps hate! thank you ohio state!
14,thank you! whoa! thank you so much and i am so happy to be here in coral springs in broward county in the great state of florida! and i know there a big overflow crowd in the next building over i think they can see and hear us but i wanted to thank them for being part of today event\n\nand ive got to recognize joshua simmons who just introduced me he is a civics teacher at pompano beach middle school and boy are his students lucky to have him and his enthusiasm and i want to also commend him for talking about his mother and how hard she worked and his sister who he helped to raise we really are stronger together and that starts in families and neighborhoods and communities\n\nwell you heard from a lot of my friends who represent you starting with my great friend and former colleague your senator bill nelson and i am looking forward to working with bill as we make sure to continue the progress that will move us all forward together and i sure hope florida sends some reinforcements to the senate and elect congressman patrick murphy i think florida deserves a fulltime senator dont you and i want to thank my friend someone who has just worked her heart out not just for her constituents but for democrats across america  congresswoman debbie wasserman schultz and another great friend of mine going back more years than we care to remember  im so pleased he here with us  congressman alcee hastings and i know that congressman ted deutch who represents this district  is over in israel for the funeral of a great great man shimon peres and i want to thank ted for all of his support and his hard work\n\nbefore i get started and really talk about everything that at stake and what we have to do the next 39 days to make sure we win this election i wanted to say a few words about the tragic passing of jose fernandez when he left cuba he did not speak a word of english he didnt let that stop him he pursued his dreams he wanted to and he became one of the best baseball players that miami has ever seen and he never forgot where he came from he worked hard to give back to the community that had given so much to him jose life really embodied the american dream and at 24 years of age he was just getting started im sure you join me in saying that our thoughts and our prayers are with his family with his fans and everyone whose life he touched during his extraordinary career\n\ni also want to mention another resident of coral springs and that a man named bob levinson my heart goes out to bob family he disappeared in iran more than nine years ago and it is long past time for the iranian regime to provide us information about his whereabouts and let him return home to his family\n\nnow did any of you see the debate the other night well i think it was pretty clear there are two very different choices for our country based on two very different visions of the kind of america that we want to have my view is we are already great and if we work together we will become even greater in the years ahead i believe america is an exceptional nation my opponent believes america is in decline ive never heard such a dark and divisive terrible image of our country coming from someone running to be president of the united states when he talks i lots of times dont even recognize the country he talking about and why are we already great well it is not just because of the size of our economy or the size of our military it is because of our generosity it is because of our ingenuity it is because of the diversity of our country i think our diversity is one of our strongest assets\n\nthis morning i laid out my plan for more national service so that more people of all ages can serve america serve their communities because america is great when you really strip it all down because america is good and we cant ever forget that\n\ni have laid out specific plans about how were going to make our country even greater ive actually got a book here with tim kaine my running mate i have this oldfashioned idea if im asking you for your vote for president i should tell you what im going to do i shouldnt just talk in generalities and use rhetoric and never answer questions about what we can do but to lay out how were going to make the economy work for everyone not just those at the top\n\nthat means new jobs  new jobs with rising incomes jobs in infrastructure jobs in advanced manufacturing in innovation and technology and yes clean renewable energy jobs\n\nmy opponent only infrastructure plan is to build a wall i love that he went down to mexico and he choked he didnt even raise it he been going around telling people for months were going to build a wall and were going to make mexico pay for it so he sitting with the president of mexico and he doesnt even bring it up he finds it a lot easier to insult women than to talk to the president of mexico about building a wall i mean really who gets up at 3 oclock in the morning to engage in a twitter attack against a former miss universe i mean he hurled as many insults as he could really why does he do things like that i mean his latest twitter meltdown is unhinged even for him it proves yet again that he is temperamentally unfit to be president and commanderinchief i have said it before and ill say it again a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not be anywhere near the nuclear codes\n\nso im going to keep talking about what we can do together after this election getting those new jobs and ill tell you another area i want to emphasize is small business as i said the other night my dad was a small businessman he made a lot of sacrifice and he worked really hard to give us a good solid middleclass life im really proud of that and im sure glad he never got a contract from donald trump who stiffs small businesses doesnt pay his bills to people like my dad but we need to do more to get small business started and growing  here in broward county throughout south florida across the state and beyond\n\nso as we grow the economy we also have to make it fairer i want prosperity to reach everyone not just the privileged few so we are going to raise the minimum wage because if you work fulltime you should not still be in poverty and you know twothirds of all minimum wage workers are women most of them supporting kids and if you work fulltime on a minimum wage job at the end of the year youve made 15000 i think we can do better and i think we should because we want everybody to have a chance to get ahead and stay ahead and go as far as their hard work and talent will take them\n\nsomething else were going to do is we are finally going to guarantee equal pay for women work now this is not my friends just a women issue if you have a mother a wife a daughter a sister who is working it your issue too to make sure she is paid fairly that will raise family incomes\n\nand then the third thing i want to do is to make sure  to make sure  more companies share profits with the workers who helped to create those profits in the first place the other night at the debate one of my guests was mark cuban he was sitting in the front row and one of the reasons i was proud to have him there is he believes in profitsharing he always in his companies shared profits and by the way he is a real billionaire and when he sold his first company he shared the profits from the sale and 300 people who worked for him who helped to make him a success became millionaires i want to lift up and use as examples business leaders like that not somebody who stiffs contractors who doesnt pay dishwashers and painters and plumbers and glass installers and architects and marble installers and so many else but somebody who has the right attitude that were stronger together in business just like we are in government and america\n\nand the other thing we have to do more of is to make sure that we help deal with some of the stresses that american families are facing it is hard to balance family and work isnt it i think we can do better i want to see us have paid family leave earned sick days affordable childcare and affordable college that includes tuitionfree and debtfree college\n\nnow after the primary was over  and senator sanders and i ran a tough primary but you know what i was really proud we ran a campaign based on issues not insults he and i got together and we said okay what are we going to do to make sure that more young people can actually get a college education because right now it way beyond what a lot of families can afford and if you go into debt you come out of it with so much debt that remains a burden on you\n\nso the other day senator sanders and i were up in new hampshire together and we were rolling out our plan and it pretty simple you can go to my website but let me just tell you briefly if you are in a family that makes less than 125000 you will not pay tuition to go to a public college or university and if you make more than that you will pay what you can afford but you will not have to borrow money because it will be debtfree for you to go and we put together a calculator on my website you can go to hillaryclintoncom/ calculator and you can see how much you will save how much your child or your grandchild would save under this plan\n\nbut i also believe a fouryear college degree which is an important part of getting an education to get ahead should not leave you mired in debt so we are going to help you refinance your debt get the interest rates down and if youre willing to do public service national service were going to forgive your debt over time\n\nbut not everyone has to go for a fouryear degree i want every person not just young people but people who are looking for a different opportunity or may have to retrain  i want to everybody to have a chance for a good solid job i think we made a mistake when we took vocational education out of high school we need to put technical education back into high school\n\nand we need to make sure that community colleges are free so that young people starting in high school can take courses at community college to get the training they need for a good job and i want to see business and labor unions working together for real apprenticeship programs  not the kind that lead to being told youre fired the kind that lead to being told youre hired\n\nnow im excited about this i really am i am confident and optimistic about our country we never get anything done if all we do is get down in the mouth and feel bad and complain and try to blame somebody for something else that not who we are as americans we need to lift ourselves up and we need to roll up our sleeves to get to work to make sure that future is what it should be for our country\n\nand while were doing that were going to make sure that our country safe and that america provides strong and steady leadership around the world sometimes when i listen to my opponent it kind of seems he doesnt know who our friends are versus our adversaries he has this weird fascination with dictators he kind of signed up for the vladimir putin wish list he doesnt care whether nato falls apart and he is really cavalier about other countries getting nuclear weapons he said he doesnt care let japan south korea even saudi arabia get a nuclear weapon whoa! that the kind of dangerous reckless talk that people around the world pay attention to\n\nas i told him in the debate  he actually said well we may or may not defend our allies in asia words matter and america word matters we have to be reliable and trustworthy people have to count on us and weve got a lot of work to do around the world we need to work hard for peace and prosperity we need to tackle climate change together\n\nclimate change is real florida knows that my opponent thinks it a hoax created by the chinese and what that means is he would not be able to take advantage of the economic opportunities that climate change presents you see some country going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century i think it going to be either china germany or us i want it to be us and it can be us if we make up our minds for that to happen let deploy a half a billion more solar panels let produce enough clean energy so that every home in america can be powered by it there so much we can do together and that means weve got to work with other countries and weve got to demonstrate that we support our allies whether theyre in europe the middle east with israel or asia that we stand with those who stand with us\n\nand then finally one of the next priorities that i have if i am so fortunate enough as to be your president is to bring our country together ive got to tell you look disagreements political disagreements that fine that who we are i dont know any two people in america who agree on everything politically with each other and ive known been fortunate enough to know a number of our more recent presidents i didnt always agree with them either including my husband but ill tell you this republicans and democrats alike i never doubt they were trying to put the country interests first they were trying to bring people together not pit us against each other and one of the things i will do from the very beginning the very first day of my administration\n\nis to make them day one  youre right  is to make sure everybody in the country knows im the president of every american every single person\n\nnow  so in order for me to do any of this anything that in this book and making sure that it paid for by the wealthy and corporations who have to pay their fair share finally all of that depends upon whether we win in november the stakes could not be higher so here is what i am asking all of you how many of you know you are registered to vote so we need to get everybody to be registered at your current address by october 11th if youve moved you may need to reregister here how you can find out if you are registered you can go to iwillvotecom iwillvotecom you put in your name you put in your address and make sure youre registered if you need to get

to hillaryclintoncom and you can volunteer and become involved if we win broward county by as big a margin as we should win it we win florida\n\nand like i say im not just excited about winning an election im excited about doing the work im excited about listening to americans ill continue to travel our country ill be here in florida so much youll get sick of me because i want to be a good partner for florida i mean florida is already suffering from climate change and you have a governor who ordered the state government never to say the word or write the phrase that kind of hard to believe so there a lot were going to do together jobs rising incomes opportunities and that what gets me excited\n\nso here what i hope you will do when you leave here if somebody says where were you this afternoon you say oh i went to a rally for hillary clinton if they say oh that great
15,hello dade city!\ni am so excited about being here thank you all for this really warm wonderful welcome and i thank on behalf of all of us i want to thank alicia machado for that introduction and for sharing her story with us alicia will be voting for the very first time in this election and i am very grateful for her support im also delighted that were joined today by your great senator bill nelson and his wife grace\n\ni also want to thank representative amanda hickman from the florida state house michael cox chairman of the greater pasco chamber of commerce michael ledbetter who is the pasco county democratic executive committee chair and his wife beverly and thanks to retired colonel wilson elton  for his pledge of allegiance and thanks to all the elected officials here and i especially want to thank all of you for not just joining us but helping us to get out the vote in this last week!\n\nit almost hard to believe isnt it there are only seven days left in this election\n\nso are you ready to vote\n\nare you ready to volunteer these last seven days\n\ni hope too that you ready to elect patrick murphy to the united states senate! patrick who been in congress will be an independent voice for florida families and i am so excited to think about what he could do because unlike his opponent he never been afraid to stand up to donald trump\n\nnow somebody asked me the other day why do you keep coming back to florida just look around folks i mean it is a beautiful and i have lots of friends but it also really important in this election florida can decide who our next president is which will affect the nation and the world and i want to make sure that every voter in florida spends these next seven days thinking about what at stake in this election because honestly i believe this may be the most important election of our lifetimes\n\none week from today we will be choosing our next president and commanderinchief of the united states i dont think the choice could be any clearer i have spent my career fighting for children and families i have served in the united states senate served on the senate armed services committee i was in the situation room when we brought osama bin laden to justice i represented you as your secretary of state going to 112 countries negotiating with friend and foe alike i am ready to serve if you give me the great honor of being your president\n\nnow i do have to say that i think that stands in contrast to my opponent and maybe for you if you think about all of the issues that separate donald trump from me it could be his dangerous statements about nuclear weapons\n\nwhen a journalist told donald trump that people were worried about how casually he talks about using nuclear weapons he said well then why are we making them\n\nand i have to tell you yesterday i was in ohio and i was introduced by a gentleman who was one of our officers in charge of launching nuclear weapons if the order ever came from our president and what he told the crowd ã\x91 it was a big crowd at kent state university ã\x91 i think every voter should hear basically ã\x91 his name was bruce blair ã\x91 he said that having had the responsibility of sitting in a bunker being responsible for the codes and the keys to our nuclear weapons he knows that when a president makes the order to launch a nuclear attack there is no appeal there is no veto and that is why he has joined with dozens of former air force officers to send a letter to say we need a president with the temperament the steadiness the calmness to be in charge of nuclear weapons and therefore they cannot support donald trump because he does not have the temperament to be our commanderinchief and handle those responsibilities\n\nso when you think about voting early this week voting next tuesday responsibility for our nuclear weapons is on the ballot\n\nso is immigration do we want to round up millions of people who are here working raising their families as he has suggested he will do i dont think so i think what we want is to bring them out of the shadows so that they cant be exploited by employers like donald trump who refused to hire americans and hired undocumented workers so he could pay them less i dont think that right\n\nnow maybe for some of you what donald trump said about prisoners of war will be enough reason to vote against him somebody who questioned the patriotism and the service of john mccain because he was a prison of war we need a commander in chief who respects the service and sacrifice of the men and women who wear our uniform\n\nor maybe for some of you it what he said about a judge born in indiana who just happened to be assigned the case brought by people who were defrauded by the phony trump university and so trump said well we cant trust him because his parents were born in mexico now paul ryan the republican speaker of the house called ã\x91 well but wait a minute ã\x91 he called what trump said about that distinguished federal judge the definition of a racist comment\n\nand then trump went on to attack a gold star family whose son captain khan died defending our country simply because that family was muslim\n\nand then let not forget trump spent years years insisting that president obama was not born in the united states even after the birth certificate was produced honestly if this were something new i think wed all be asking ourselves well what does he have against president obama or what does he have against me but this is not new i know im reaching out to republicans and independents as well as democrats because i want to be the president for all americans\n\nand here what i want you to tell i want you to tell your republican friends in 1987 donald trump took out a donald trump took out a 100000 ad in the new york times to criticize president reagan he said our leaders are the laughing stock of the world so this is a man who thinks that he is better than president reagan better than president obama  literally better than anybody i guess and when you think about it what he said at the convention i alone can fix it runs counter to who we are as americans we work together\n\nso there are many reasons why i think it is fair to conclude that donald trump is unqualified and unfit to be president but today i want to just spend a few minutes focusing in particular about what he has said and what he has done to woman and girls because  any of you see the debates i stood next to donald for four and a half hours during those three debates proving conclusively i have the stamina to be president of the united states and during those debates donald always used to say what have you been doing for 30 years and i always found that kind of odd because he could google it and find out and so ive been a lawyer and ive been a first lady and ive been a senator and ive been secretary of state and ive been a wife and a mother and a grandmother and a friend and a churchgoer and for my entire life ive been a woman\n\nand when i think about what we now know about donald trump and what he been doing for 30 years he sure has spent a lot of time demeaning degrading insulting and assaulting women and ive got to tell you some of what weve learned  some of this stuff is very upsetting i would frankly rather be here talking about nearly anything else like how were going to create good jobs and get the economy working for everybody not just those at the top how were going to make college affordable for every single family because i have a plan that if your family makes less than 125000 you will not pay tuition to go to a state college or university and if youre above that it will be debt free and we will help you pay back the debt you already have so you can get out from under it\n\nbut i cant just talk about all of the good things we want to do because people are making up their minds this is a consequential choice so weve got to talk about something that frankly is painful because it matters we cant just wish it away and a lot of his supporters dont like to hear this i dont blame them if i were supporting him i wouldnt want to hear it either to be honest but ive got to tell you i learned way back in elementary school and i learned it in sunday school it not okay to insult people it not okay\n\nand look at what he does he calls women ugly disgusting nasty all the time he calls women pigs rates bodies on a scale from 1 to 10 we just heard from alicia she was miss universe when donald trump owned the pageant well he said she put on some weight and it made him angry so he called her miss piggy he called her miss housekeeping because she a beautiful latina he brought a bunch of reporters to a gym to watch him order her around to exercise now he also said this is somebody who likes to eat well i have to say who doesnt like to eat i mean really can we just stop for a minute and reflect on the absurdity of donald trump finding fault with miss universe\n\nbut youve got to ask why does he do these things who acts like this and ill tell you who a bully that who and thankfully alicia refuses to let such a small person get her down she knows that donald trump doesnt get to decide her value in her eyes and in the eyes of her family and her friends\n\nbut what about our girls what about girls watching all this what happens to their confidence their sense of selfworth if youve got a daughter a granddaughter a sister a mother a wife a good friend someone like this becoming president who insults more than half the population of the united states of america and what about our boys this is not someone we want them looking up to\n\nnot so long ago i was the mother of a teenage girl and every day i tried to make sure that she knew she was smart and she was capable and im doing the same thing with my granddaughter and my grandson because let be honest here the world has a way of telling our girls exactly the opposite  they dont look right theyre not thin enough they dont act right no one will like them unless they change their clothes or straighten their hair or stop being bossy or whatever the criticism might be right\n\nand i remember when chelsea was a teenager i would wait on the second floor of the white house in the long hall that there for her to come home from school and sometimes we only had a few minutes together but before shed run off to talk to her friends or do whatever she was planning to i would figure out how was the day wed talk about what was on her mind and that time together was really valuable to me as a parent because we parents and i know there are a lot of parents here today we work hard to give our kids a sense of confidence to send them out into the world believing in their own value and it really is important that we dont let anybody take that away from them and we want them to be strong and we dont want them to feel bad about themselves and weve got to work hard to make sure our boys just like our girls have that same sense of positive energy not negative not tearing people down  lifting people up and respecting women\n\nin fact all of us should respect each other in our country so when i look at my granddaughter and my grandson i am on the same mission i want them to know theyre love theyre cared for theyre respected i want them to develop a good work ethic i believe in hard work and i want them to go out and prove themselves in the world but that what i want for every child i have spent my life doing everything i could to help kids and families it will be the mission of my presidency i will get up every day in the white house trying to figure out how can we knock down the barriers overcome the challenges so that people living here in pasco county can get ahead and stay ahead\n\nso i know there work to be done we cant do it with just words alone weve got to do more to stop treatment about women being somehow objectified and oh my gosh when we heard that tape and we heard what he does to women im not going to repeat it but you know what donald trump was bragging about grabbing women mistreating women and i have to tell you since that tape came out twelve women have come to say that what he said on that tape is what he did to me\n\nand then we heard his response what he does at his rallies is to go after those women all over again insulting them he said he couldnt possibly have said those things because the women werent attractive enough to assault look at her he said about one woman i dont think so about another he said he wouldnt be my first choice\n\nhe also on tape bragging with the radio personality howard stern about how he used to go backstage at beauty pageants to barge in on the women while they were getting dressed he said he did that ã\x91 he said he did that to inspect them that was his word  and he said i sort of get away with things like that and sure enough contestants have come forward to say yes that exactly what he did to us now as bad as that is he didnt just do it at the miss usa pageant or the miss universe pageant he also been accused of doing it at the miss teen usa pageant contestants say that donald trump came in to look at them when they were changing some of them were just 15 years old\n\nwe cannot hide from this weve got to be willing to face it this man wants to be president of the united states of america and our first lady michelle obama spoke for many of us when she said donald trump words have shaken her to her core\n\nfor a lot of women who have gone through something like this in your lives that brought back painful memories and for men who would never ever talk or act like donald it been shocking to see this he tried to explain it away as locker room talk well ill tell you what a lot of professional athletes stood up and said not in our locker rooms that does not happen\n\nwell i guess the bottom line is he thinks belittling women makes him a bigger man\n\nand i dont think there a woman anywhere who doesnt know what that feels like\n\nhe doesnt look at us and see full human beings with our dreams and purposes our own capabilities and he has shown us that clearly throughout this campaign\n\nwell he very wrong he is wrong about both the women and the men of this country he has shown us who he is let us on tuesday show him who we are we can stand up for what we believe what we want for our children and grandchildren what we know is right and you can go down the list of everything he has said he doesnt believe in equal pay he thinks pregnancy is an inconvenience he wont raise the minimum wage and he said if he comes home and dinner is not on the table he gets angry instead of supporting women who are out there supporting their families he wants to make it even harder\n\nwell i have a message for him were going to fight for affordable childcare were going to fight for equal pay for all people were going to fight for paid family leave were going to fight to make sure everybody gets raising wages in america and that important because so many people still struggling still working hard raising a family having a hard time getting all of their bills paid and that especially true for minimum wage workers ã\x91 who ã\x91 twothirds of whom are women so weve got work to do my friends im excited because i know we can do this and i will stand up and i will fight for you i will work for you i will give my heart to this mission of making our country all it should be because instead of donald trump dangerous and divisive vision mine is positive optimistic hopeful and unifying\n\nbut i cant do any of this without your help early voting has already begun almost 26 millions americans have already voted and that includes four million right here in florida americans are voting for the kind of better future we can make together and voting on all the issues that they care about it may be my name and donald name on the ballot but everything you care about our security our economy bringing our country together the environment clean water and clean air!\n\nhere in dade city you can vote every day from now until november 5th from 7am to 7pm\n\nin fact right now the east pasco government center is just a few minutes drive away you can go there right after this rally and vote because we need everybody to stand up in this election\n\nand if you have a mailin ballot at home send it in when you get home today\n\ndont wait to send it back! talk friends and family and neighbors and coworkers\n\ndonald trump strategy is pretty simple he said he wants to suppress young people from voting women from voting people of color from voting that is a lot of people by showing up with the biggest turnout ever we will show him and everybody a message that that is not who we are\n\nnow i know here in this county and this larger region you probably know some people who are going to vote for trump and here is what i want to ask you i want you to talk with them ask them what they care about ask them what kind of future they want for their economy because donald trump economic plan is slashing taxes on the wealthy and big corporations i have said that i want the wealthy to pay their fair share and i will not raise taxes on anybody making less than 250000 a year\n\nso there could not be no matter what you care about a bigger difference between me and donald trump and i hope that you will come out and volunteer for these last seven days\n\nwe are signing up for volunteer shifts making calls knocking on doors it really matters turn out matters\n\nplease go to hillaryclintoncom to see how you can get involved here is what i want to leave you with you know i feel like so many of you our country is already great but we can make is greater the main reason america is great is because america is good we are a big hearted generous people not a small minded people we know that if everybody works together we will get farther together than if we separate people we push them down we engage in all the negativity that we have heard too much in this campaign but sometimes the fate of even the greatest nations lie in the balance for america this is one of those make or break elections it really is in your hands\n\ni hope you will think about how you will feel the day after the election on november 9th are we going to more forward together or are we going to move backwards by someone who wants to bully us and i hope i hope you will think about how together we can make a difference i want to be your partner as well as your president i want us to create the best possible future for our children and our grandchildren that is what i will work my heart out to do and i hope you will help me to make a better fairer stronger america where we prove once and for all that love trumps hate!\n\nthank you all
16,go daytona beach! wow thank you thank you so much \n\nnow i think you and i agree the choice is pretty clear between a president who ready to bring us together keep us safe and make the economy work for everyone not just those at the top and someone who is temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified for the job\n\nnow i promise you this i will never stop working for you every single day as a candidate and most importantly as your president that how i was raised when i was over at bcu i met one of the methodist ministers because bcu is affiliated with the methodist church and i felt right at home and my mother  my mother taught me to never ever quit now what does that mean well that means everybody gets knocked down what matters is whether you get back up and ive been fighting for families and underdogs my entire life and im not stopping now were just getting started\n\nand let always remember what our wonderful first lady told us when they go low we go high so no matter what they throw at us in these last days were not going to back down were not going to get distracted were not going to get knocked off course because we know how much the election matters we know how many people are counting on us and that why were going to reject donald trump dark and divisive vision about america\n\nwe are going to stick together and we are going to win on november the 8th right because donald trump strategy is pretty simple theyve even said it in his campaign it to get women to stay home get young people to stay home get people of color to stay home and get a lot  get a lot of smart intelligent men to stay home too now this is all part of his scorched earth campaign it goes against everything we stand for and you know how we stop him by showing up with the biggest turnout of voters in american history\n\nwe need more of everybody to vote  more women more young people more people of color more african americans more latinos everybody let break every record that weve ever had for voting let make that the story of this election and here in florida you can as you often have make the difference right florida if you all vote and you get everybody you know to vote if you go out and talk to people today and every day about what at stake in this election then we will make history we will win up and down the ballot and i feel strongly about this because we need people in washington who are problemsolvers not problemmakers that why i hope youll vote to send patrick murphy to the senate he will be an independent voice for florida families and this is important unlike his opponent patrick has never been afraid to stand up to donald trump\n\nnow here some really good news we just reached a milestone more than 200 million americans are registered to vote that is the highest number ever and that includes 50 million young people that the most in history and you know what else more than 165 million people have already voted in this election and more than 3 million of those votes have been right here in florida now you only see numbers like were seeing here in florida when people are standing up for what they really believe in americans are coming together and i know because i hear from people who are republicans and independents who are joining us to reject hate and division rejecting donald trump demeaning treatment of women his plans to break up immigrant families and deport millions of people his lie that president obama wasnt born in america\n\nill tell you we have learned who donald trump is now it up to us to show who we are and the energy that we are seeing is not just about what were against it about what were for it about a common vision that we share for a hopeful dynamic unified america where everyone counts everyone has a place everyone willing to work can get ahead and stay ahead where women are respected  where veterans are honored where workers are paid fairly where marriage is a right and discrimination is wrong\n\nso my friends it is not just the fact that my name will be on the ballot everything we care about is at stake  your future  making college affordable helping you pay back your debt  the cost of prescription drugs down  protecting and defending social security and medicare from privatization and wall street schemes fighting climate change is at stake lgbt equality is at stake equal pay for women is at stake in the end we know that american dream itself is at stake\n\nnow did any of you see the debates\n\nwell ill tell you i stood next to donald trump for three debates four and a half hours proving conclusively i have the stamina to be president and commanderinchief but i have to tell you he said a lot of things that were troubling but in that last debate he said something that was truly horrifying he is the first person of a major party republican or democrat ever to refuse to say he would respect the outcome of the election now we can think about every issue we care about but you know after attacking women and african americans and latinos and people with disabilities and muslims and pows and everybody now he attacking the institutions of democracy and so it comes down to this when your kids and grandkids ask what did you do in the 2016 election when everything was on the line i want you to be able to say you voted for a better fairer stronger america\n\nand the way were going to do that were going to turn everybody out early voting has begun right here in volusia county every day from 7 am to 7 pm until november 5th you can vote the nearest early voting site is just one mile away from here at the volusia county library center in city island so dont wait one more day go vote and then help us get everybody else out to vote too\n\nnow i know  i know that weve got our canvass organizers up here i dont want to take too much of their time because they are workers they are organized they are focused im so grateful to them and to you and we need you we need you stakes couldnt be higher we got to do everything we can i dont want anybody waking up on november 9th and saying oh i wish i had just done a little more so help us knock on doors make phone calls talk to voters and ask them when are you going to vote do you know where youre going to cast your ballot who will you take with you and make sure they know about early voting already begun here in florida and then if you need to sign up yourselves we have signups for three more shifts between now and election day and this is going to be a close election they always are these days and were going to win because of you because of hardworking volunteers like you and if you know anybody thinking about voting for donald trump stage an intervention remember friends dont let friends vote for trump\n\nand think about it this way on january 20th were going to have a new president and ill tell you what i will be proud to build on the progress weve made under president obama and go even further but i cant do any of the things that im talking about any of the plans that i have unless you help me so that what im asking you that why i came to daytona beach today i came to ask you to help me in these last ten days let give every american a chance to chart their own future make their own contributions let build a future we can all be proud of and let make sure we prove once and for all that love trumps hate\n\nthank you
17,hello! hello chci! it is so great to be back here with so many friends and to see so many young people here because that fits the theme this year educate engage vote and i cant think of better marching orders for the next 54 days  and anyone who just heard the congresswoman knows we cannot be on the sidelines this is the most consequential election in our lifetimes\ni want to recognize the institute for all you do to inspire the next generation of latino leaders last year i had the chance to spend time with some of the chci interns and fellows it really was like seeing the future of america in one room i cant wait to see everything that they achieve and i cant wait if im fortunate enough to be president to put some of them to work!\n\nand i want to thank all my friends in the congressional hispanic caucus you fight every single day to lift up the latino community  when the cameras are rolling and when the cameras are off at home in your districts and here in washington and no one understands better than you the pivotal moment were at right now  not just for latinos but for our country\n\nmy friends in the caucus have traveled to every battleground state registered voters youve stayed focused no matter what kind of outlandish and offensive comments we have heard from my opponent and his supporters by the way i personally think a taco truck on every corner sounds absolutely delicious\n\nnow here a confession running for president is never easy but it shouldnt be right but tonight i have the ultimate challenge speaking after president obama he always a tough act to follow in more ways than one\n\ni for one dont think the president gets the credit he deserves for rescuing our economy from another great depression think of what weve achieved these last eight years american businesses have created 15 million new jobs since the recession twenty million americans have health coverage  and no one has seen a bigger drop in uninsured rates under the affordable care act than latino americans we got more good news this week a report came out showing that poverty is going down and incomes for american families are going up and latino families have seen the biggest increase of all\n\nnow that doesnt mean we rest on our laurels by any stretch our work is far from finished but i am more confident than ever that our best days are still ahead of us i believe with all my heart that the american dream is alive and it big enough for everyone to share its promise that doesnt mean that lots of people are still not hurting because i know they are and when you hear a presidential candidate spewing bigotry and hate it easy to get discouraged but were here because we know this election is a choice between not just two people but two very different visions for our america future\n\neither were going to make our economy work for everyone or just those at the top\n\neither were going to fear our differences or embrace and celebrate our diversity\n\neither were going to pit americans against each other and deepen the divides or were going to be stronger together\n\ntoday as you know were in the midst of hispanic heritage month in classrooms across america children will study dolores huerta and cesar chavez julion and joaquin castro justice sotomayor roberto clemente and laurie hernandez gloria estefan and linmanuel miranda and countless others  names we know and names we might not know but every one of whom has enriched this country for generations\n\nwhether youre mexican puerto rican cuban latin american afrolatino whether your family just arrived or has been here since before the united states even existed  youre not strangers youre not intruders youre our neighbors our colleagues our friends our families you make our nation stronger smarter more creative and i want you to know that i see you and i am with you and time and again  time and again we have seen that when we invest in the community when we make it possible for latinos to get the health care you need get the education you desire compete for jobs start new businesses pursue your dreams all of america benefits\n\nas i said this afternoon in north carolina we are in the final stretch of this election and i intend to close my campaign the way i began my career fighting for kids and families that been the cause of my life it will be the passion of my presidency so tonight i want to mention two things ill do in the first 100 days of my administration to help families in every corner of america\n\nfirst we do need to create an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top there something wrong when latinos are 17 percent of our country population but hold only 2 percent of its wealth weve got to work together to connect more latinos with good jobs that pay good wages with more opportunities to get the skills they need to go to college to launch new ventures to build wealth that can be passed on to your kids and your grandkids so were going to make in my first 100 days the biggest investment in new goodpaying jobs since world war ii jobs in infrastructure manufacturing technology innovative clean energy\n\nand were going to cut red tape and taxes and expand access to capital for small businesses including the latinoowned small businesses that create so many jobs and so much growth in communities everywhere and i want to give a particular shoutout to latina small business owners not everyone knows this but you are among the fastestgrowing group of entrepreneurs in america and were going to put families first with new solutions that reflect the way people live and work today supporting families with paid family leave earned sick days and affordable childcare isnt a luxury it a necessity when families are strong america is strong\n\nand that brings me to another important family issue in those first 100 days i will send a proposal for comprehensive immigration reform to the congress my proposal will keep families together and it will include a path to citizenship now i know this isnt the first time youve heard it in fact people have been making the same promise for more than a decade but i believe with all my heart that some things are too important to give up on ive been called a lot of things ive never been called a quitter\n\nand in this election  in this election we have a chance to show that comprehensive immigration reform isnt just the smart thing to do it what the american people demand and you know how well show that well i hope to have a democratic congress next january  but no matter what on my first day in office i will reach out to republicans and say this is your chance to help millions of families and show that your party the party of lincoln is better than donald trump\n\nand while were fighting for comprehensive immigration reform were going to keep families together when the deadlocked supreme court put dapa and expanded daca on hold for 5 million immigrants it was devastating to millions of families but the court didnt actually rule on the substance of the case and as ive said repeatedly i believe dapa and expanded daca are squarely within the president authority and will i protect them and keep fighting for them\n\nbut in addition to defending dapa and daca there more we can do we need a simple straightforward system where other people with sympathetic cases who are contributing to their communities can make their case and be eligible for deferred action too like people who experience and report extreme labor abuses and we wont stop there were going to end family detention close private detention facilities and stop the raids and roundups no child should have to say goodbye to their parents every morning not knowing if their mom or dad will be there when they get home\n\nso here the bottom line comprehensive immigration reform will not only be the right thing to do but it will add 700 billion to our economy and enable america to be what it always been  a place where people from around the world can come to reunite with family start new businesses pursue their dreams apply their talents to american growth and innovation\n\nnow i know this has been a long road and we wouldnt be where we are today without your persistence and the quiet courage of families in every state of our union and we certainly wouldnt be here without the bravery of the young men and women who have risked their very place in the united states by coming forward and fighting for their own future and the future of millions of others they helped change the conversation and when president obama created daca it changed their lives\n\nright now 750000 undocumented young people in america are going to school working and planning for their future theyre dreamers in much more than name ive met so many ive listened to their stories theyve done everything weve asked of them and made our country stronger in return\n\nso when donald trump promises to rip that all away on day one when he promises to round up and deport all of the 16 million people living and working among us including american citizen children who were born here to parents who are undocumented these are the faces i see\n\ni picture astrid silva  who i met in las vegas many of you know her story she came to this country from mexico at the age of four with nothing but a doll a cross and the dress she was wearing now she in her 20s advocating for the rights of everywhere\n\ni picture a young man i never met whose high school teacher wrote me a few months ago to share his story his teacher told me that his former student was funny enthusiastic and patriotic he played the drums in the school marching band and after graduation in 2005 proudly enlisted in the us army before shipping off to iraq he stopped by the school so everyone could see him in his new uniform\n\nhe was his teacher wrote as respectful and optimistic as any student who ever entered my classroom he was also a dreamer brought here as an undocumented child he loved america and hoped one day to earn his citizenship but in april 2007 while on a mission in baghdad he was killed by an improvised explosive device he was just 19 the army called him a hero and he was posthumously granted the american citizenship hed always wanted\n\nall these years later  his teacher still treasures his memory and this teacher wanted me to know  he wanted me to know that despite what donald trump may say immigrants are not rapists and criminals the truth is this young man may not have been born here but he represented the best values of our country\n\nwe teach our children that america is one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all not just for people who look a certain way or worship a certain way but for all everywhere i go people tell me how concerned they are by the extreme policies and divisive rhetoric theyve heard from my opponent  from the racist lie about mexican immigrants that launched his presidential campaign to his racist attacks on a federal judge\n\nand every time we think he hit rock bottom he sinks even lower his latest target a minister in flint michigan who respectfully asked him not to use her pulpit for political attacks he called her a nervous mess\n\nhow insulting how dead wrong reverend faith green timmons is not a nervous mess  she a rock for her community in trying times and she deserves better and so does america and again today he did it again he was asked one more time where was president obama born and he still wouldnt still say hawaii he still wouldnt say america this man wants to be our next president when will he stop this ugliness this bigotry\n\nnow he tried to reset himself and his campaign many times this is the best he can do this is who he is and so we need to decide who we are if we just sigh and shake our heads and accept this then what does that tell our kids about who we are we need to stand up and repudiate this divisive rhetoric we need to stop him conclusively in november in an election that sends a message that even he can hear we need to set the kind of example we want for ourselves and our children and our grandchildren\n\nparents and teachers are already worried about what theyre calling the trump effect bullying and harassment are on the rise in our schools especially targeting students of color muslims and immigrants\n\nat a high school basket game in indiana white students held up trump signs and taunted latino players on the opposing team with chants of build the wall and peak english\n\ndonald trump is running the most divisive campaigns of our lifetimes his message is you should be afraid  afraid of people whose race or ethnicity is different or whose religious faith is different or who were born in a different country there no innuendo or dog whistles anymore it all right out there in the open now so weve got to come back twice as strong and twice as clear\n\njust this week a mother in florida wrote to me about her 11yearold son francisco he proud to be american colombian ecuadorian and puerto rican as he calls it a potluck of hispanic heritage and francisco has been following this election very closely his mother told me he wears his love trumps hate pin every day and refuses to take it off when his father warned him that might make him a target for bullies francisco looked his father in the eye and he said i was always told to stand up for myself and what i believe in and i believe trump is wrong and good for you francisco\n\nthat what we have to do in this election and that what so many of you are doing already standing up to the bullying and bigotry wherever it comes from\n\ntogether we must send this resounding message and we need to inspire a level of turnout that will help us win up and down the ticket\n\nweve set an ambitious goal of registering and committing 3 million people to vote in this election that would not have otherwise voted and we cant do it without you nearly half of latinos in america are under 35 and we need you to show up and make your voices heard in this election\n\nso were going to keep asking for your help keep hitting the campaign trail please talk to your friends your neighbors your community  everyone you see between now and november 8th tell them to go to hillaryclintoncom or text join join to 47246 to get involved this election is too important for anyone to sit on the sidelines as we heard from congresswoman sanchez\n\nso let stand up for a future where we put families first where we build bridges not walls\n\nand yes together we can prove love trumps hate thank you all very much
18,hello bwa i thank you all for that warm welcome there nowhere id rather be than right here with all of you this morning\nplease everyone be seated this is such a great opportunity to lift up the work that so many of you have done for years  your organizations individually  and i am grateful for it because it has helped to guide me in a lot of the work that ive been privileged to do\n\ni want to thank gwen hess for her introduction i want to acknowledge it always great to see a woman serve as president in any setting\n\ni want to congratulate today honorees everyone is so deserving of this recognition i also want to acknowledge a few others we have some fierce members of congress with us today women whom i admire who have been my colleagues and friends and with whom i am looking forward to continuing our work congresswoman sheila jackson lee congresswoman gwen moore congresswoman yvette clarke congresswoman stacey plaskett\n\nand i want to give a special shout out to congresswoman joyce beatty when i saw joyce recently she said well you are coming arent you and i said im working hard to get it set and i am so proud that it did work out and i thank joyce for that extra push\n\ni also want to acknowledge someone who had such a profound effect on my life in every way someone whom i admire and love marian wright edelman this audience is filled with longtime friends and people i went to wellesley college with that became lifelong friends to me and so many of you who have been on the front lines  everyone associated with the black women agenda im thrilled to be with you im thrilled to be associated with you im also thrilled to be back on the campaign trail as the world knows i was a little under the weather recently the good news is my pneumonia finally got some republicans interested in women health\n\nlooking back i know i should have followed my doctor orders to rest but my instinct was to push through it that is what women do every single day and i felt no different life has shown us that we do have to work harder at the office while still bearing most of the responsibilities at home  that we always need to keep going because our families and our communities count on us and i think it is more than fair to say that black women have an even tougher road\n\nand you your daughters your granddaughters  i was pleased to meet gwen beautiful granddaughter earlier  leave the house every morning put on that game face that we all practice and enter a society that consistently challenges your worth with the images you see the lower pay that so many take home that try to silence your voices and break your spirits yet you remain fierce in the face of these challenges we see that every day in the businesses you start the art you create the children you teach and the communities and organizations you lead while your stories are often missing from the history books  make no mistake  you are the change makers the path breakers and the ground shakers and you are proof that yes indeed black girl magic is real\n\nnow ive been blessed to see this magic influence on kids and communities up close for decades starting with my first job after law school working with marian at the children defense fund marian belief was that every single child had worth and potential and deserved the opportunity to live up to their god potential with the tools and the support that every child needs and that if we just improve the odds a bit for those suffering in poverty they could flourish so she led our team into some very poor communities we met kids who had dropped out of school because they couldnt afford textbooks or transportation some didnt have decent clothes and stayed home to avoid being humiliated in class some had untreated medical and dental problems that made it practically impossible for them to learn those stories really hurt my heart\n\nbut marian always believed we could deliver help and hope if we never ever gave up so she taught us ways to think creatively as well as strategically to take our advocacy and turn it into action and results she sent me to new bedford massachusetts to go door to door looking for children who werent in school that was back before we had a legal requirement that every child regardless of disability deserved to get an education i met a young girl in new bedford and sat and talked with her on the small back porch of her house she told me how badly she wanted to learn but couldnt because schools werent accessible or welcoming so marian had us get to work and change that\n\nwe gathered evidence and built a coalition we helped convince congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilities marian showed me that to drive real progress you have to change both hearts and laws you need both understanding and action and there is no question im here today because of her example i also want to recognize pioneers like barbara jordan and shirley chisholm who sacrificed and struggled so that i and so many other women running for office could soar im here because of friends and colleagues like donna brazile reverend leah daugherty and congresswoman marcia fudge ã\x91 three black women who ran the democratic national convention in july it was a great four days\n\nit goes to show that black women deserve more than a seat at the table it past time you had a fair chance to run the meeting and let be clear i would not be the democratic nominee for president of the united states were it not for black women like all of you who made noise at the polls this year in support of our campaign  who did surrogate events went to barber shops and beauty salons and cafes got on local radio and local tv to make the case weve come far together\n\nand as i said yesterday in north carolina im going to close my campaign the way i began my career all those years ago at the children defense fund and the way that i will serve as your president should i have the great honor of being elected i will be focused on opportunities for kids and fairness for families the american people deserve something to vote for not just against\n\nand together  together we are going to make this a freer fairer and stronger nation\n\nwere going to fight for the parents struggling to balance family and work and push for affordable child care paid family leave and yes finally equal pay for women\n\nwell fight for the young girls who want a fair chance in life which is why well make universal prek available so that every child  no matter what they look like or where they live  can rise up and be prepared to fulfill their academic destiny\n\nwe are also going to do a lot to emphasize stem education particularly for girls and women and i thank the agenda for making that a priority!\n\nwell fight for the entrepreneur who said that more businesses die in the parking lots of banks than anywhere else which is why were going to increase access to capital and we are going to help african american women continue to represent the fastest growing segment of womenowned businesses in america right now\n\nwe are going to invest in communities that have been left out and left behind urban reinvestment and restructuring that is going to give more people decent housing access to jobs the transportation to get to those jobs rural communities that are too often ignored and denied the services they need i am a fan of jim clyburn 102030 plan i am going to do everything i can to push that forward\n\nwell remember the pain of the mothers of the movement and fight for a criminal justice system that actually delivers justice and a future where everyone has respect for the law and is respected by the law and we are going to pass commonsense reforms to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people and keep our communities safe\n\nwell remember the families neglected in flint and take action so that no child life is ever put at risk again when brushing their teeth or drinking a glass of water at dinner well advocate for everyone concerned about their parents and grandparents as they age and lift up caregivers and home care workers so older americans can live in comfort and with dignity\n\nand were going to protect and enhance social security which is the main source of income for older women well standbyside to make sure that all of our rights are respected and protected  civil rights and women rights lgbt rights worker rights and of course voting rights\n\nwe are coming together at a pivotal moment for our country now i do believe that every election is important but this one feels different doesnt it that because it is the next 53 days will shape the next 50 years the future of our children and grandchildren hangs in the balance\n\non one hand we have my opponent donald trump and in recent weeks he tried to restrain himself and clean up his image but as maya angelou once said when someone shows you who they are believe them the first time and we know who donald is for five years he has led the birther movement to delegitimize our first black president his campaign was founded on this outrageous lie there is no erasing it in history\n\njust yesterday trump again refused to say with his own words that the president was born in the united states donald advisors had the temerity to say he doing the country a ervice by pushing these lies no he isnt he feeding into the worst impulses  the bigotry and bias  that lurks in our country\n\nbarack obama was born in america plain and simple and donald trump owes him and the american people an apology so my friends there is no new donald trump there never will be donald trump looks at president obama after eight years as our president he still doesnt see him as an american\n\nthink of how dangerous that is imagine a person in the oval office who traffics in conspiracy theories and refuses to let them go  no matter what the facts are imagine someone who distorts the truth to fit a very narrow view of the world imagine a president who sees someone who doesnt look like him and doesnt agree with him and thinks that person must not be a real american\n\ndonald trump is unfit to be president of the united states we cannot become insensitive to what he says and what he stirs up we cant just accept thisweve got to stand up to it if we dont it wont stop\n\nin addition to the president donald trump looks at a distinguished federal judge born in indiana and he sees a mexican not an american he looks at a gold star family and sees them as muslims not patriotic americans he looks at women and decides how our looks rate on a scale of one to 10 i look at america i see everyone i see our great diversity which is one of our core strengths not our burden we know who donald trump is now it time for our country to show who we are and reject his divisive vision\n\nthat why this election is so important as michelle obama said at the democratic convention when we go to the polls this november the real choice isnt between a democrat or republican it about who will have the power to shape our children lives for the next four years it also about the kind of country we want to be and what we want to leave behind for future generations\n\nwe are at our best when every person gets to share in our nation promise contribute to its progress tronger together is not just our campaign slogan it the guiding principle for the future we need to build so americans we need to ask themselves are we going to make our economy work for everyone or just for those at the top are we going to bring people together or pit americans against each other and rip our country apart are we going to work with our allies to keep us safe or are we going to put a loose cannon in charge who would risk everything that generations of americans have worked so hard to build\n\nnow in many ways the profound choice is up to the women in this room african american women turned out to vote more than any other group of americans in 2012 this year once again you have your hands on the wheel of history and you can write the next chapter of the american story\n\nkeep up the great work with your four for 4 campaign make sure we get as many people registered and then to the polls as we possibly can people say to me all time i just  i dont know what to do about trump and his supporters and the things he says and inciting violence and all of the terrible activities that are happening this election year\n\nwell here what we can do let reject the cynicism the bullying the divisive rhetoric that my opponent uses to make us afraid of each other afraid of our differences afraid of our future i know that all of us in this room are ready to stand up against this  to rise up for our families our communities but most importantly to show up at the polls this november\n\nwith our power and strength i know  i believe this or i would not be standing here before you i would not have run again for president i would not deal with all the incoming brickbats that are hurled my way if i did not in my heart believe with every fiber of my being that together we can build a future where yes love trumps hate\n\nthank you very much thank you
19,hello it so great to be back here with all of you tonight i want to thank my friend congressman jim clyburn don peebles representative butterfield members of the congressional black caucus and congratulate all of the honorees on a personal note i want to recognize a dear friend who is retiring after 46 years congressman charles rangel he is one of a kind and we are grateful for your years of service\nand what can i say about one of the best presidents this country has ever had barack obama all through this campaign i have made the point over and over again president obama saved our country from a second great depression he brought osama bin laden to justice and so much more i for one dont think he gets the credit he deserves for doing what he done on behalf of our country and the world and it not just the president he been but the man he is even when hateful nonsense is thrown their way barack michelle their two beautiful daughters have represented our country with class grace and integrity as michelle says when others go low we go high i know i speak for not just everyone in this room but so many tens of millions of americans mr president not only do we know you are an american youre a great american! and you make us all proud to be americans too\n\nlet me thank the leadership of the cbc foundation for this great honor and to thank all of my friends in the congressional black caucus for it as well i dedicate it to all the trailblazers who came before me who blazed trails that i could follow in their footsteps  barbara jordan shirley chisholm i would not be standing here without them generations of women and men who struggled and sacrificed and cleared a path for all of us\n\nthis award is also for everyone out there helping to break down the barriers holding americans back to leaders like all of you and to a rising generation of young activists to all those on the front lines dedicated to the proposition that in america every single child deserves the chance to fulfill his or her godgiven potential this has been the cause of my life ever since i went to work for the children defense fund all those years ago and im going to close my campaign the way i began my career and the way that i will serve as your president focused on opportunities for our children and fairness for our families\n\nwe have so much work to do together ive heard many heartbreaking stories over this campaign one was from tianna gainesturner a working mother to three children from northeast philadelphia she testified at the dnc platform meeting in june and told us how her husband had been laid off and she worked in a parttime job she said shed been hungry more times than she could count and that life felt like a maze because she faced barriers no matter which way she turned but despite all of this tianna has hope she still believes that her 8yearold daughter will be president one day and she believes that this election can make all the difference in the world to her and her family let prove her right\n\nas a country we have a moral obligation to give her family and every family a chance to rise up and reach their dreams that is what at stake in this election it not about golf course promotions or birth certificate it comes down to\n\nwho will fight for the forgotten who will invest in our children and who will really have your back in the white house\n\nwe need ideas not insults real plans to help struggling americans in communities that have been left out and left behind not prejudice and paranoia we cant let barack obama legacy fall into the hands of someone who doesnt understand that whose dangerous and divisive vision for our country will drag us backwards instead we need to come together to get incomes rising with a higher minimum wage to invest in neglected communities with efforts like jim clyburn 102030 plan to get guns out of the hands of dangerous people to fight for a criminal justice system that actually delivers justice and to make sure that all kids have good schools and good teachers no matter what zip codes they live in\n\nwhen you really think about it the choice this november is about so much more than democrats and republicans as michelle obama said at the democratic convention it about who will have the power to shape our children for the next four years of their lives it also about the kind of country we want to be what we want to leave behind for future generations i thank everyone here who has been fighting for this vision over so many years i thank all who have supported me i want you to know im not taking your vote or anyone vote for granted im working every single day to earn your support and i need your help over the next 52 days to bring our campaign across the finish line together\n\nbarbara jordan famously said that a government is invigorated when each of us is willing to participate in shaping the future of this nation so to everyone here tonight please keep doing what youre doing but also help to register voters tell others about the clear choice in this election in some states early voting is nearly here so we need to keep the pressure on let send a loud and clear message once and for all we are stronger together and no matter what remember this love trumps hate thank you all very much!
20,thank you! thank you all so much wow! i am so happy to be back here in iowa on a beautiful fall day to see all of you and i especially want to thank janelle for her introduction and i so appreciate that janelle and nora and her husband stu are here today i remember so well when i met her back in 2015 and i saw that sign and my best friend from sixth grade was also going through breast cancer and being treated and when i saw janelle sign it just made me think about my friend and i wanted to go over and meet this woman who had been through 13 chemo treatments already and we just clicked and i have been so grateful to be able to get to know her better and spend time with her when i see her and i got to introduce her to my best friend when my best friend came to iowa so the circle is completed and more people are reaching out and finding ways to help each other\nnow before i came out i had the great great privilege of saying hello to someone ruline steininger who is  is ruline still here i know she was going to try to stay there she is hello ruline! hello ruline! ruline is a 103yearold resident of pleasant hill who was born in 1913 i am so grateful for her support and i dont know if any of you have seen the videos both about janelle and about ruline but i really do recommend that you see them both ruline talks about this long active life that she had and everything she has seen happen in america and the world and i think it important to have that perspective so it a great honor to have ruline supporting me i am so pleased and she going to go vote early today to make sure her vote counts\n\ni want to thank dr andy mcguire for chairing the iowa democratic party fighting so hard to elect democrats and i want to lift up and thank our democratic senate candidate patty judge where patty patty out there fighting hard every single day and she can use your help to make a strong case for her to go to the senate and jim mowrer the 3rd district congressional candidate jim is running a great campaign and we are really looking forward to having him in washington but that really depends upon everybody here and everybody across the great state of iowa\n\nnow while were meeting on this beautiful day here in des moines i know our friends in cedar rapids and the region are once again facing the potential of flooding i talked with the mayor i talked with city council members and other leaders over the last day or so they hope that they will not have the flooding they took a lot of good precautionary measures our campaign along with thousands of people came out and helped to put the sandbags in to try to prevent flooding and i told them that if im so fortunate enough as to be president were going to have a big infrastructure program and were going to help prevent flooding in places like cedar rapids\n\nnow i also just want to say on a personal note i was terribly upset this morning to learn about a train crash in new jersey that very personal to me i live in new york people commute into new york from new jersey we had about a hundred commuters injured and one died i just want to send our thoughts and prayers to them because it a horrible accident that ran into the depot and caused all kinds of damage so i want to lift up the people of new jersey and new york today\n\nnow we are starting to vote in iowa today! and i saw my good friend ruth harkin and she told me she was the first person in line to vote today and we have what 40 days 39 days left and each and every one of you have the chance to make sure that we keep our country on the right path we have 40 days to win an election that going to affect the next 40 years of our country and you every one of you can make the difference in this election\n\nnow how many of you participated in the caucuses well weve got a bunch of active iowans here are you ready to go to the polls well luckily in iowa you can start today lots of folks dont have that opportunity across the country and a lot of our campaign volunteers are going to direct people right from this rally to early voting sites weve got one right down the street so when you finish here you can go vote and we can be on the path to victory here in iowa\n\nany of you see that debate on monday night well one down two to go well i have to tell you it was an extraordinary experience because i did get to say a few things about the positive agenda that we want to have for our country because i want this election to be about something not just against somebody and so i am going to close this campaign the way i started decades ago fighting for kids and families because it been the cause of my life it will be the mission of my presidency because i know from my own experience that strong families are the base of a strong america and i know from personal experience how important it is to give people the tools they need to make sure that they can go as far as their hard work their talent will take them\n\nnow you may have heard me say this i started talking about this way back in the beginning of the campaign here in iowa but i was very fortunate none of us picks our parents but i really was fortunate my dad was a navy veteran a small businessman and he worked hard every single day to build a good life to provide financial security a good solid middle class life and i know how hard he worked because occasionally id go down to his print plant where he printed fabrics for draperies and it was not a very big building it didnt have any natural life there were no windows in it it what he could afford\n\nand there were two long tables and hed roll out the fabric and then he would take a silkscreen any of you ever seen a silkscreen an oldfashioned silkscreen not far from here there a wonderful tshirt store right and they still use silkscreens for some of their printing so he would take that silkscreen and hed put it down and he would pour the paint in then hed take a squeegee and hed go across it and then hed lift it up and hed go all the way down the table and if there was going to be more than one color hed do it all over again and then when he finished he would gather it up and put it in his car and hed go deliver it to the customer who had ordered it\n\nthat how i was raised to think about doing business you do your best you enter into a contract or an agreement somebody orders your goods or your services and then they pay you for it right and as i said the other night one of the things that we have found out is that as his own campaign manager said about him donald trump has built a lot of businesses on the backs of the little guy her words and i have met people who have been the victims of his refusal to honor contracts to pay what had been bargained for i just am grateful that my dad never did business with him or somebody like him because we couldnt have survived all that\n\nall that work and then to be told were not going to pay you or maybe well pay you 10 cents on the dollar or 20 cents that just wrong what kind of person does that takes advantage of dishwashers and painters and architects and glass installers and so many people weve been looking into the records and there a long list of people who have been mistreated i just dont believe that the way were supposed to treat each other in america and that sure is not the way our president should be treating our citizens in our country\n\nnow my mom had a very different story my dad father was a factory worker but they had a strong family my mom was abandoned by her parents and then sent to live with grandparents and they didnt want her so she was out on her own by the age of 14 she was working as a housemaid and a babysitter and it may sound harsh but i will quickly tell you that it was the first time in her young life that she ever was in a family that showed love and respect for each other so for her it was a gift\n\nand then she got another gift the woman she worked for knew that my mom wanted to go to high school and so the woman said if you can get up really early and you can get your chores done and get the little kids off to school you can go to high school but youll have to come right back that may sound harsh for a 14yearold but for my mother it made all the difference and that exactly what she did for four years and most days she had to run  run  to get there but she didnt care because she wanted to get an education\n\nso when i learned more about my mom life i knew that what i wanted to do was to stand up for kids and families and especially for kids whove been left out or left behind in some way that why i went to work for the children defense fund and learned quickly that kids with disabilities were not in our public schools back then and we worked to put together a coalition and convince congress to pass the law and boy every day i am so thankful for your former senator tom harkin who made the rights and opportunities of people with disabilities the centerpiece of his distinguished career\n\nso that been my mission how are we going to do more to help kids and families and so when i talk about the economy  because i think we have three big issues facing us number one we need an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top right we need to keep our country safe and we need to lead the world with strong and steady leadership in accordance with our values and we need to bring our country together we have to heal these divides\n\nbut when i think about the economy yes i want more new good jobs with rising incomes i see my friends from the laborers here we need to do work that builds our roads our bridges our ports our airports our tunnels our water systems our sewer systems this is good honorable work and boy do we have a lot of it in america we are living off the investments that our parents and our grandparents  and sometimes even greatgrandparents  made if were going to have a competitive economy we need to be building america again and we also need to do more advanced manufacturing and some of the most exciting developments i saw throughout this whole campaign were right here in iowa i saw in your community colleges some of the most advanced training that ive seen anywhere in the country and i met young men and women who were getting credentialed to be able to leave high school to get good jobs as machinists and tool and die makers and as designers using 3d printing i was so impressed and i think we need to do that across america and we need to bring technical education back to our high schools it was a mistake when we took vocational education out of our high schools\n\nanother way that iowa has influenced and inspired me is what youve done with clean renewable energy now it wasnt a partisan issue in iowa it really got a big boost from your wonderful former governor tom vilsack but it been continued over the years and look at the results look how much energy you are getting here in iowa from clean renewable sources most particularly wind right and look at the number of jobs  it nearly 10000 jobs now that are related to that plus the renewable fuel standard which has motivated people to be creative about using biological material and experimenting with cellulosic material i was in the forefront of moving toward a clean renewable energy future and im excited by that\n\nim running against someone who thinks climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the chinese i know it real i believe in science but ill tell you what else is real what real are the economic opportunities the new jobs and businesses were going to create by assuming the responsibility to combat climate change and the young people of our country are going to lead the way to doing that now we also need to help small businesses iowa is filled with small businesses it should be easier to start one it shouldnt be so cumbersome to deal with all the multitude of regulations were going to try to streamline that process being the daughter of a small businessperson i believe in giving people the chance to have their destinies in their own hands and were going to work hard i want to be a firstclass small business president in honor of my dad and im going to do everything i can to help you get started and grow small businesses\n\nbut while were growing the economy we need to make it fairer and here are a couple of things i want to do let raise the national minimum wage so people who work fulltime are not still in poverty ive met  you know two thirds of the people on minimum wage are women  and ive met a lot of minimumwage workers right here in iowa and across america sometimes they have to take two minimumwage jobs because a fulltime minimum wage job will earn you 15000 at the end of a fulltime year of work we also could give the biggest boost to incomes and particularly family incomes if we finally guaranteed equal pay for women work\n\nand the other thing i want to do is make sure more companies adopt profitsharing so if you helped to create the profits all of you not just the top executives will be able to share in those profits you know at the debate the other night one of my wellknown supporters mark cuban was there in the front row and he really i think unsettled my opponent but ill tell you mark cuban a real billionaire who actually uses profitsharing and not only while the business is ongoing but one thing i really appreciate first business he sold he shared the profits with all of his employees 300 employees became millionaires because they had a boss who rewarded them for the hard work they did to make it a successful company all together\n\nand the final point i want to make about this is about family economics you know let tackle the cost of childcare between 2000 and 2012 childcare costs went up 25 percent incomes barely budged right so were going to increase federal investment and provide more tax relief to working families so no parent has to pay more than 10 percent of their income for quality childcare now if you dont have small children or grandchildren right now you might not realize the cost of childcare in a lot of states is more expensive than tuition at public colleges and universities a lot of families are just so stressed out\n\nthe other thing i want to do is to finally have our country join the rest of the advanced economies and provide paid family leave so you can take care of your family members now a lot of people think this is primarily about newborn babies adopted babies and of course that a big part of it last year in newton a mom said to me im counting on you to know what it like trying to take care of a newborn and having to go right back to work right\n\nthat a lot of you there you are okay and ive got to tell you i hear that all over when my granddaughter was born and i was in the hospital with my daughter i was talking to one of the nurses and i said so what is your biggest worry she said well my biggest worry is that so many of these new moms have to go right back to work right back to work but it not just for babies it for sick children sick spouses elderly members of your family who are having health problems there is nothing more important than caring for each other and i will tell you it is wrong to make it so difficult for american families\n\nthe other big expense for family economics is education every one of our children deserve good teachers and good schools no matter what zip code they live in right and we also have to make college affordable yesterday in new hampshire i was with my friend and my former opponent senator bernie sanders i am very proud of the campaign that bernie and i ran it was a campaign about issues not insults and we shared a lot of the same goals even though we have different ways of getting there and so after it was over he and i sat down and we began to hammer out some ideas about what we could do together and one of them was to make college tuition free for any family whose income is 125000 or less and to make it debtfree for everybody else so that you only pay what you can afford to pay without going into debt\n\nnow right now iowans hold more than 12 billion in outstanding federal student loans an education should give you a boost not hold you back and were going to offer relief to those of you who already have debt we have 40 million people who already have student debt in america 300000 of them right here in iowa were going to help you refinance it is outrageous that you can get a home mortgage at 3 percent a car payment at 2 percent and i met people in iowa who were paying 8 10 12 percent interest on their student loans ill tell you what i am not going to let the federal government make a profit off of lending money to young people to get their educations\n\nand college is crucial but this is not said often enough fouryear college is not and should not be the only path to a good job that supports a middleclass life so were going to have real apprenticeships not the kind where youre told youre fired but the kind where youre told youre hired were going to help more people in high school and community college on the job learn a skill\n\nso im excited about what we can do together i know so much of this campaign has been about you know whatever my opponent says and who he attacks and who he derides and denigrates and the list is long but it not about that it about you it about your families and your futures and each of us should be telling you what we intend to do in the job now i have this oldfashioned idea im asking for your vote i should tell you what im going to do what my plans are so tim kane and i have actually put out this little paperback book and i see somebody holding one in the front row it called not surprisingly tronger together you can pick it up at a bookstore or an airport wherever they sell paperbacks and you can see what were trying to do and where were going to get the money to pay for it and the simple answer to that is were going to make the wealthy and corporations finally pay their fair share to support america\n\nnow my friends my opponent has a very different vision for america he actually bragged about gaming the system to get out of paying his fair share in taxes maybe not paying any taxes at all and what i really find so disturbing about this is he spends all of his time just dumping on america calling us a third world country saying our military is a disaster that everything about america is in bad shape but then it probably true he hasnt paid a penny in federal taxes to actually support our military or our vets or our schools or our roads or our education systems he actually is proud of the fact that he lets everybody else pay taxes he says that makes him smart\n\nwell ill tell you what if not paying taxes makes him smart what does that make the rest of us my husband and i have put 40 years of our tax returns out into the public you can go and look at them and you can see that weve been blessed and were grateful for that but we have paid the highest marginal tax rates and we are glad we could because we have both benefited from this great country of ours and we want to pass that on to the next generation and the one after that\n\ndonald trump is also proud that he rooted for the housing crisis back in 2008 and 9 think about that five million families lost their homes and he rooted for it because he said he could make money off of it he even said that it is just business well what kind of person believes that  that throwing people out of their homes foreclosing on them destroying the dreams of hardworking people is just business well ill tell you that a person who should never be president because they dont understand the american dream and how hard it is for people to make it\n\nso look i think after  thank you i think after what we saw monday night well have two more debates to be able to contrast and compare i have no idea what he going to say the next time but you know i will spend some time preparing for it\n\nbut we cant do any of the things that i just talked about or anything that you see in our book without your help the future of our country the future of our economy and the future of our society will be on the ballot it breaks my heart to see all the meanspirited divisive bigoted things that are being said in our country we can have our differences for heaven sakes were americans that in our dna but we should respect one another we should listen to one another that the way were going to get things done together\n\nand so i want you to join this campaign the election will be close but we can win iowa and were going to win on november 8th so if you can text join join to 47246 or go to hillaryclintoncom and sign up to volunteer if youre not sure if youre registered see these signs i will vote iwillvotecom you can go to iwillvotecom put in your name and your address to make sure youre registered because sometimes people get dropped off the registration lists and they are surprised when they show up to vote that theyre not on it so check that out and then vote and get everybody you know to vote and i hope that a lot of you will go to vote after today after this beautiful rally were having because we will prove that we are stronger together and you know what else well prove we will prove that love trumps hate\n\nthank you all very much
21,hello detroit! thank you! i\ll tell you i am so glad to be back in michigan and that introduction i\m just still vibrating from it i thank my longtime friend reverend wendell anthony for giving us some of the best lines that we\ve had in the whole campaign thank you wendell\nyou know there\ something special about this place and some of you may have recognized the song that was playing when i came in an amazing anthem sung by the talented andra day called \rise up\ and that is what detroit is doing  you are rising up! and that is exactly what we\re going to do in america we are going to rise up and make sure the american dream is big enough for everyone\n\ni\m looking forward to working with the great team you have here in detroit and in michigan i want to thank your senators senator debbie stabenow and senator gary peters i want to thank your members of congress congressman john conyers sandy levin congresswomen brenda lawrence and debbie dingell i want to thank your great mayor mayor mike duggan and thank you wayne county executive warren evans sheriff benny napoleon the president of the uaw dennis williams longtime friends and former colleagues of mine former senator carl levin and his wife barbara are here and to all who are present today and i was delighted that my friend and my supporter mark cuban could be here because  he\ not only a real billionaire  he\ actually shared his profits with his employees\n\nnow are you ready to vote on tuesday are you ready to volunteer to get everybody out to vote are you ready to choose our next president and commanderinchief did any of you see the three debates that we had well i spent four and a half hours standing next to donald trump proving once and for all i have the stamina to be the next president\n\nnow he kept saying a lot of unusual things didn\t he and you know there\ a certain preparation you do to be ready for those debates and of course i did it because i think you should prepare to be president of the united states and i did practice my composure people said to me well how did you do that the things he was saying and then in that second debate when he was following you around and lurching over you i said well i did practice and i had my friends and my family just spend hours saying terrible things to me so i was ready but he would say like \well what have you done for 30 years\ and you know i don\t want to brag but i do think it matters what you\ve done and especially what you\ve done that maybe improves somebody else\ life right\n\nand one of the great joys of this campaign has been traveling around our country meeting people who have been affected by what we\ve been doing for example as first lady i helped create the children\ health insurance program which covers eight million kids and these are families that they\re not poor families they\re working people but they don\t make enough money and they don\t work for somebody who provides insurance and so very often their kids were being affected by not getting the health care they should have had i met a woman whose baby daughter when she was born was diagnosed as totally deaf and the doctor said \we\re sorry there\ really nothing we can do for her\ but this mother like many mothers i know did not take that for an answer right she got on the internet she began to research and she found that there were treatments that she could maybe provide to her little daughter but they were expensive and she and her husband didn\t have that kind of money and they didn\t have insurance she was at her doctor\ office and just so distraught and the doctor said \well there\ this new thing called the children\ health insurance program maybe you should look into it\ turned out she was eligible she signed up she started giving her daughter the best health care that every child in this country should be able to have by the way and when i was in north carolina i heard about her and i got to meet her but more than that i met her daughter who talked to me and who just graduated from college  because she got the health care and she got the treatment that she deserved to have\n\ni\ll tell you what that is how i judge my last 30 years have i done something to help somebody else i am well aware of the blessings that i have had and i want to be sure that all of us figure out a way to pay it forward make it possible for more families more kids to have the chance to live up to their own godgiven potential\n\nand i was a senator in new york on 9/11 so i know what can happen  the evil and the hatred of terrorism i saw it and i spent my time helping to rebuild new york city and helping to get health care for the brave first responders who ran toward danger not away from it  our police our firefighters our emts and i\ll tell you who else we got covered we got construction workers who ran with their supplies and their tools and i see one right out there who knows exactly what i\m talking about all across the city people were leaving their job sites and rushing toward danger that was america at its best and don\t ever forget what we are capable of being who we are we are not afraid we are brave courageous people who will do our best if given the chance\n\nas your secretary of state i went to 112 countries negotiated ceasefires reduced the threat of nuclear weapons stood up for human rights and women\ rights and worker rights and lgbt rights i\m telling you this because i want you to know that i will do everything i can if i am honored to be your president i will get up every day in that white house and i will go to work for you and your families to make it possible for you to get the chances and the opportunities you deserve to have\n\ni want you to have a candidate you can vote for and not just someone to vote against that\ why tim kaine and i have run a campaign based on ideas and issues not insults because if you really take a look at what is at stake in this election it is a choice between two very different visions for america i\ve got to say when i hear my opponent talk about america i don\t recognize the country he\ talking about it is so dark so divisive so hateful that is not the america that i believe in i believe that we should have a confident optimistic inclusive vision of where we\re going and how we\re going to get there i love our country and i believe in the american people and i think there\ nothing we can\t achieve if we work together and we set some goals and we go after them you see we believe in an america that is bighearted not smallminded we believe in an america that is already great but can be greater if we do our part and we believe america is great because america is good never forget that if we lift each other up and not tear each other down we can go even further and i believe with all my heart that\ why the slogan of my campaign sums it up that we are stronger together\n\nand so come next january 20th america is going to have a new president i know  i know that  i know that a lot of people say that they want change well let me tell you this change is inevitable there will be change the question is what kind of change are we going to have\n\nare we going to build a stronger fairer better country or are we going to fear the future and each other i sure hope not that is not the america that i believe we are\n\nand so here is what i want to ask you to do i want you to talk to your friends and your family and your neighbors michigan is one of these states that doesn\t have early voting i\ve been all over the country going to states that are already voting in fact i don\t know about 31 to 323 million people have already voted in those states but michigan votes on tuesday\n\nand i imagine  i imagine there are  some of you know people who say they\re going to vote for donald trump right i know i know i understand that i mean i would hope you would try to stage an intervention before it\ too late but maybe you could ask them with you to imagine imagine january 20th 2017 and imagine that my opponent is taking the oath of office in front of the capitol imagine having a president who demeans women and mocks the disabled who insults african americans and latinos and muslims who personally engages in busting unions and preventing people from having the right to bargain collectively now the truth is we really don\t have to imagine what that would be like because everything he has said and done both in his career and in this campaign tells you what could happen\n\nnow michelle obama who says so many wise and wonderful things she said the presidency doesn\t change who you are it reveals who you are and i think we\ve seen who donald trump is\n\nmaya angelou another great american maya angelou said when someone shows you who he is believe him the first time and if my opponent were to win we would have a president who has only ever been in it for himself\n\njust last year he said again it wouldn\t have mattered if we had rescued the auto industry or let it go bankrupt what is he talking about i\m proud that president obama saved the auto industry and i\m even prouder that because of the hard work of people in detroit and across michigan and the midwest the us auto industry just had its best year ever\n\nif donald wins the election we\d have a president who wants to ban every muslim in the world from coming to visit the united states we are a country founded on religious freedom that runs contrary to our constitution we would have a president who has said repeatedly that he thinks the lives of black people are all about crime and poverty and despair he has no idea about the strength of the black church and the vibrancy of blackowned businesses and the excellence of historically black colleges and universities he seems to know nothing about the rise of a new generation of black activists and the success of black leaders in every field i think he needs a visit from reverend wendell anthony don\t you\n\nyesterday in north carolina i was honored to stand with a woman named mae brown wiggins decades ago she was a hardworking nurse in new york city she was looking for an apartment that she could afford to rent but donald trump and his father fred turned her away you see whenever african americans tried to rent trump apartments their application was marked with a \c\ c for colored and that didn\t sit very well with mae so she went to the authorities and eventually the department of justice sued the to us for housing discrimination and although they settled they wouldn\t change so the government had to take them back to court that\ a pattern this is what happens time and time again with my opponent if he were to win he would be in charge of the federal housing department if he doesn\t respect all americans now how can we trust him to serve all americans in the future\n\nhe has such a casual disregard of our constitution he doesn\t seem to understand the rule of law that we really are a nation of laws not men here\ the latest example there was a terrible crime back in 1990 in new york city it was called the central park five maybe some of you have heard of it there were five black and latino kids some as young as 14 they were wrongfully convinced and they were in prison where they spent years donald trump took out fullpage ads calling for the death penalty for the kids and even after they were exonerated by dna evidence and someone else confessed to that terrible crime trump actually said they should still be in prison it doesn\t matter if you\re innocent if he decides that you should be in prison or you should be locked up no wonder he admired vladimir putin because that\ exactly what putin does to his people\n\nso we can\t trust him with our constitution we can\t trust him to obey the rule of law he has shown us who he is now we have to decide who we are so let me paint you a different picture here is what we\re going to do together if we win this election on tuesday night\n\nwe have three big challenges number one we got to get the economy working for everyone not just those at the top number two we\ve got to keep our country safe and we have to work with our allies to lead the world with strength and intelligence toward peace and prosperity number three we\ve got to bring our country together we have got to overcome these divides we have to heal our nation and i hope that you will help me meet all three of those challenges\n\ni have said repeatedly that we\re going to take on discrimination and bigotry because any time we hold somebody back it can lead to holding other people back we can\t accept as normal what we\re seeing across our country because of his campaign a church in mississippi was burned this week someone painted \vote trump\ on the side and then set it on fire we can\t let  we can\t let that happen what happened in flint michigan should not be normal or acceptable our kids should be guaranteed clean air and clean water those are basics we\ve got to do everything we can to make sure that we take care of our children\n\nand it\ important for us to recognize that when i talk about getting the economy to work for everybody that means i want the biggest jobs program since world war ii  infrastructure advanced manufacturing clean renewable energy technology some people say we can\t do that well i\m telling you they\re wrong they\re wrong we have the best workers the most productive workers we\re going to give them more to work on more products to produce and we\re going to do more for small business because small business is the backbone of so many communities and i want everybody to have the chance to succeed in america that means we\re going to dismantle the socalled schooltoprison pipeline and replace it with the cradletocollege pipeline\n\nand we\re going to make sure that every child has a chance to go to a good school with good teachers no matter what zip code that child lives in and i want to start with our youngest kids with prekindergarten programs and then i want to be a good partner with our teachers we\ve got to have high expectation and get results in helping our children and i want to be sure that we put technical education back into high school because there are good jobs out there waiting for young people with the skills to do them\n\nit\ll be important that we create an environment in which our police and our communities can work together and trust each other i believe we are safer when everyone has respect for the law and everyone is respected by the law and that\ what we\re going to work for\n\nwe\re also going to take commonsense steps to reduce gun violence and save lives this has nothing to do with the scare tactics coming from my opponent have you seen he\ starting to wear a camo hat now really we are going to work with responsible gun owners who understand that we\ve got to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn\t have them in the first place\n\nand while we create more safe communities we want to invest in those communities i want to continue the good work that our past two democratic presidents have done one named clinton one named obama and i want to be a really strong partner i\ll compete a little with them i want to be a really strong partner with detroit and other cities that are on the way back up to make sure you get the investment and the support the housing and the jobs that you need\n\nbut we also have to make sure our economy is fairer that\ why i believe we should raise the national minimum wage because people who work full time should not be left in poverty and isn\t it finally time to guarantee equal pay for women this is not a women\ issue if you have a wife a mother a daughter or a sister who works it\ your issue it\ a family issue and every time i talk about wanting to have affordable childcare paid family leave equal pay for women the other side accuses me of playing the women\ card i\ll tell you what if standing up for equal pay is playing the women\ card then deal me in\n\nand one of the other big challenges we\re going to take on  i am so excited about this i am really proud of the campaign that bernie sanders and i ran because it was a campaign about issues and what we decided after it was over is how we could work together to make sure that everybody who wants to go to college can afford not just to start but actually to graduate so we came up with a plan that if you go to a public college or university you will go tuitionfree if your family makes less than 125000 a year and it will be debtfree for everybody above that so you don\t go into debt and for people who already have student debt we\re going to help you pay it down and pay it off to get out from under it and i want especially to support historically black colleges and universities that have done so much to bring forth a leadership cadre in our country\n\nnow this is just some of what we are offering in this campaign because we really believe you need to look at what will happen after the election i had a friend say to me the other day \people are just frustrated and angry\ i get that i understand that we had the worst economic collapse since the great depression in \08 and \09 millions of people lost their jobs millions lost their homes family wealth was wiped out that is a trauma and people are still suffering and still climbing back from that i get it but i learned a long time ago from my late mother anger is not a plan right be angry vent about it and then roll up your sleeves and get to work that\ what i will do that\ why we\ve put this all down it\ on our website hillaryclintoncom it\ in a book that tim kaine and i put out called \tronger together\ because not only do i want you to know what i will try to do as your president i want you to hold me accountable i want you when i come back to detroit which i will do when i travel around michigan which i will do i want you to say \well how\ it going getting those new jobs started how much progress are we making on making sure college is affordable\ i believe in making lists maybe it\ a women\ thing my husband said  once said to me one time \you have lists of your lists\ well i do because i want to know what we\re going to get done and how we can make progress together\n\nand ultimately this election really is about the kind of country we want for our kids and in my case now my grandkids are we really a nation that believes in freedom and justice for all\n\n yes\n\n are we really a nation that recognizes our best years can still be ahead of us if we make up our minds to have that be our goal i believe we can do this together my opponent at his convention said \i alone can fix it\ well no nobody alone does anything when our founders met in philadelphia it wasn\t one person creating our country it was many people working together and fighting a revolution to get that democracy and then to fight for civil rights and voting rights and workers\ rights and women\ rights and lgbt rights none of them  none of them were won by one person alone the american labor movement didn\t happen because somebody one day said \i alone can make it happen\ it took millions of people in every one of these movements marching and speaking out and sitting in barack obama wasn\t put into the white house by one person alone it took everybody working and organizing and yes voting that is how progress happens in america\n\nso really it all comes down to you my friends you have to vote our progress is on the line everything that has happened up until this point is on the line i\m ready to defend and build on the progress that we\ve made i\m proud i was a member of president obama\ cabinet i\m proud that  he and i are friends but he knows and i know that american leadership american presidents it\ like running a relay you do your very best and then you pass off the baton and you just hope that the person you pass it off to doesn\t drop to the ground or doesn\t turn around and run back the way we came from which is what my opponent is promising to do\n\nnow i\ve told the president that when he hands off the baton that he\ going to have to bend over he\ a lot taller than i am but i\m excited about what we can do i know this has been a tough campaign i\ve got people coming up to me saying they\ve got migraines they never had before they have stomachaches that they don\t know what they\re going to do with i get it it has been in many ways a really tough campaign but i\ll tell you what michigan you can make the difference\n\nall i\m asking you is talk to your friends talk to your family talk to your coworkers talk to everybody if you have time to volunteer go to hillaryclintoncom to volunteer or text \join\ join to 47246 because when your children  and there are some beautiful children in this crowd here today when your children or grandchildren ask what you did in 2016 when everything was on the line i want you to be able to say \i voted for a better stronger fairer america\ an america where we build bridges not walls and where we prove once and for all that love trumps hate let\ get to work thank you thank you detroit thank you michigan god bless you
22,thank you thank you all so much it is great being here on the stage at unh with my friend bernie sanders one of the most passionate champions for equality and justice that i have ever seen and someone who i am looking forward to working with to get  the kind of agenda through our congress that will begin to make our country stronger by providing the kind of support that working families and middle class families so richly deserve\nbernie campaign energized so many young people some of you in this crowd and there is no group of americans who have more at stake in this election than young americans because so much of what will happen will affect your lives your jobs the kind of country we are the kind of future we want to build together\n\nim proud of the primary campaign that bernie and i ran we ran a campaign about issues not insults and when it was over we began to work together to try to figure out how we could take the issues we agreed on and come together knowing we are stronger together to come up with specific policies in education in health and so much else thank you bernie thank you for your leadership and thank you for your support in this campaign\n\nnow were going to need some help in washington and i hope new hampshire will send your now governor maggie hassan to washington as your senator and i sure hope you will send carol shea porter back to washington\n\nisnt this one of the strangest elections youve ever seen i  i really sometimes dont know what to make of it standing on that debate stage the other night i was especially thinking about that and look i have been very clear about what i want to do if im fortunate enough to be elected president and americans increasingly are zeroing in on the fact that were not only electing a president were electing a commanderinchief were looking to see who can protect our country and provide steady and strong leadership around the world\n\ni was very honored today to earn the endorsement of john warner a retired republican senator world war ii veteran former  former secretary of the navy who served under two republican presidents i served with him on the senate armed services committee and i have the deepest respect for his patriotism and it a great honor he never endorsed a democrat for president before and im also very grateful that a number of republicans and independents here in new hampshire have announced their support for this campaign in fact it is really an extraordinary honor that 150 republicans here in new hampshire are supporting this campaign because they understand how high the stakes are\n\nthe next  the next 40 days will determine the next 40 years so im going to close my campaign the way i started my public service and my career fighting for kids and families that been the cause of my life and it will be the mission of my presidency and when you go to vote in november or if you vote early it not just my name on the ballot every issue you care about think about it because in effect it on the ballot too it whether or not we continue to fight climate change or we give in to denial this is a big deal i never thought when i gave my acceptance speech to the democratic national convention that i would have to put in the following sentence i believe in science climate change is real it serious and we have to be united and committed in addressing it i never thought id hear someone running for president my opponent who says he wants to appoint supreme court justices who would overturn marriage equality and turn the clock back on lgbt americans overturn a woman right to make her own healthcare decisions and reverse that fundamental right and so much more\n\nso there a lot at stake and that why some of the analysts are saying more americans will vote in this election than ever before we had more people watching that debate than any presidential debate before and that why we have to focus on what we want to do because i want to make a difference in your lives\n\nand one of the biggest issues that i heard about throughout the campaign that i hear about from every corner of our country is how much an education costs bernie is absolutely right i remember when i went to college my dad who was a small business man  he had saved up money but i had to work i had to work through college work during the school year work during summers but that was okay we were able to put it together it wasnt so much that it endangered me or my family financial future\n\nand then i decided to go to law school and my dad said well i cant help you that  were done we cant help you so i kept working i got a small scholarship but then i took out loans and i paid those loans back but i was lucky because i signed up for a program that gave me the opportunity to pay my loans back as a percentage of my income not a fixed interest rate that why i could go to work for the children defense fund i think i made 14000 a year as i recall i could never have done that if i had had the kind of interest rates that so many young people now are facing\n\nit absolutely wrong and it has undermined the fundamental right to pursue your dreams to have that education to get those opportunities that you so rightly deserve\n\nnow new hampshire has the highest proportion of students with debt in the country and the secondhighest average debt per student as a student i met here in new hampshire said going to college should be hard but paying for college shouldnt be so hard that it prevents you from getting your education\n\nindeed here in new hampshire weve got so many young people graduating with debt who arent able to get started in their careers arent able to do the jobs like i could do because they have to get a job that pays as much as possible to begin paying their debt down so we should and we will make public colleges tuitionfree for families earning less than 125000 a year\n\nand if you already have student debt like so many students have here in new hampshire we will help you refinance it it is absolutely outrageous that you cannot refinance student debt and it is even worse that youre being charged interest rates that are so much higher than anything that anybody else is paying to buy a house to buy a car to borrow money for a business i dont know how we got to where we are but we are going to fix it this is wrong it wrong for students it wrong for families and it wrong for our country\n\ni also have met a lot of young people who want to start a business they want to be entrepreneurs it the classic american story start that business in the garage or the basement get going but they cant get credit because they have student debt nobody will help them out no matter how good the idea is so were going to put a moratorium so you dont have to pay your student debt back for a couple of years while you try to get your business started and you get the chance to get the credit you need\n\nwe are also  we are also going to provide loan forgiveness for people willing to go into public service or national service and in florida on friday ill give a speech about why that is so important\n\nnow when you add it up our plan will help millions of people save thousands of dollars our campaign has built a tool to help you see how our college plan will actually help you not in general but really specifically you the situation youre in to check it out go to hillaryclintoncom/calculator\n\nnow we have an example right here and this presentation is what you can see when you go to our website you can say i have student debt you can say i am planning for college you can put in what your annual household income is how much you will save and we are trying to make it as specific as possible because i dont want anybody to miss out on what this plan can do for you you can choose whether you have student debt\n\ni met a young woman just yesterday in north carolina who said nobody really explained to me and my family what i was getting into i hear that so much you know these financial aid forms one is called fafsa it takes forever to fill out and at the end of it you really dont know what it means well were going to be really explicit you know we do have technology in america and we ought to use it more to help people understand what theyre getting into and to provide alternatives so that they dont make the wrong decisions for themselves\n\nso please use this you know you will save 60640 if youre in one of these categories but there is a way to understand the choices you have to make for everybody so i hope you will go to hillaryclintoncom/calculator\n\nbut i have to say this none of this will happen if you all dont turn out and vote none of it you know i see all the signs saying i will vote there is also a website please go to iwillvotecom to make sure youre registered all the information is there you put in your name you put in your address and through the miracle of technology you can find out if youre registered or maybe because you moved you were purged from the records and you have to register again new hampshire makes it easy you can have sameday registration\n\nso both bernie and i are excited about what we can do together i am really looking forward to working with him and other strong democrats and republicans who want to help solve problems again in america bringing people together is what im going to spend a lot of my time doing as your president and if youve had a chance to see or meet my running mate tim kaine you know how hard hell work to get things done and make it a high priority to produce results\n\nso were going to move now to the panel and im very pleased to have mary jo brown moderating along with doug martin who you heard from earlier i know they have collected up questions from the crowd but i will end by saying that im excited about what we can do to make college affordable and especially as bernie rightly said open the doors to families and young people who have been left out we also want to make pell grants once again available yearround and we want to make sure that we have  specific help for certain groups of students\n\nill end with this story i taught at the university of arkansas law school some years ago and i met a lot of students not only in the law school but students on campus id go and eat with them and go to events with them and i met a lot of students who scraped together the tuition money but then something happened you know maybe they were already parents and their childcare fell apart maybe they had to drive to and from school they lived out in the country and their old car finally broke down and there was no public transportation or maybe they had a health emergency and they would come and they would say to me what can i do where can i get the 300 to fix the car where can i find childcare how can i pay the doctor bills\n\nand i realized that weve got to take care of tuition making sure that you can go and be able to start and finish school weve got to make sure costs and expenses pell grants and other ways of helping but we also have to fill the gaps that exist for a lot of students so i helped to start something called the arkansas singleparent scholarship fund because the people who had the most unexpected expenses were young parents mostly but not always single moms young divorced pretty much on their own trying to improve their lives and prospects\n\nand we started a fund to help fill those gaps and you know we did it over so many years now about 35 years and weve helped thousands of people so they didnt have to drop out they didnt have to cut back that what i want for our country again where were helping each other where were reaching out and giving everybody a chance and yes sometimes a second or third chance to make the most of their lives to pursue their dreams i think the american dream is big enough for everybody and education is absolutely essential to it\n\nso please make sure you come out and vote in this election thank you all
23,hello! thank you! thank you so much thank you thank you so very much wow what  what a wonderful welcome it is great to be here in fort pierce in this beautiful theater i love being in the sunshine state i really want to recognize a few people us congresswoman lois frankel is here as you saw randy perkins a candidate for congress kim johnson chair of the st lucie county commission larry lee jr state representative everyone all of the elected officials all of the students and young people it is wonderful to be with you\nand i want to thank eileen for her introduction we know how hard that nurses like eileen work and now that she is retired she is volunteering for our campaign this woman never quit and eileen we are so glad you are on our team\n\ni am grateful to all of the elected officials all of the commissioners the county commissioners martin county st lucie for all you do for the community but especially for all you did this summer to clean up the algae that polluted the water that threatened wildlife and made life hard for local residents and businesses this is a serious and complicated problem isnt it for the entire treasure coast and it is a reminder if we needed it how important good leadership is so i thank all the leaders for their commitment\n\nnow there are just 39 days between now and november 8th just 39 days left in the most important election in our lifetimes\n\nweve got to make every single day count we have to get more people registered to vote get more people committed to turn out to vote we have to drive home the stakes in this election stronger families safer communities and an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top and underneath all of the rhetoric and the coverage and the back and forth this campaign really comes down to two questions what kind of future we want for ourselves our kids and our grandkids and how do we make it a reality\n\nnow as i said it the other night  how many of you saw the debate\n\nwell as i said i now have two grandchildren and no offense to anybody the two most wonderful amazing extraordinary a little girl and a little boy so i think a lot about the future and you may have noticed that my opponent and i have different views about  well nearly everything when it gets right down to it  not just about what makes america great because i think america already is great  but about what we should do to make it even greater and about that basic question about how progress happens at all\n\nmy opponent believes in what i call a trongman approach he stood on that stage at his convention and described a hopeless broken nation i am sorry i am looking at you i dont see that that in no way resembles the strong vibrant america i know and here what he said he said i alone can fix it i alone\n\nwell we have learned that that his way one person getting supreme power and exercising it ruthlessly that why he admires dictators like vladimir putin so much but that not how change happens in america it never just one person not even someone as powerful as the president every good our country has ever achieved has always happened because people have worked together to make it a reality not just the wealthy or the powerful  all of us\n\nwe see that every day across america and i bet many of you have been a part of it maybe you taught kids to read right or cleaned up your local park or the beach maybe you have organized a cancer walk or you have run a food drive whatever it is chances are you have done something to serve your community and by extension your country\n\nhow many of you  just think back over your lives  how many of you have performed some kind of service of some sort for your community for other people the reason i know you have is because tens and tens of millions of americans do some kind of volunteering in your hometowns every single year it one of the best things about the american people we are doers we dont just shrug our shoulders when we see something that needs fixing we dont get resigned or pathetic or blame other people and turn on each other to find scapegoats we roll up our sleeves we get to work to try to make things better in our neighborhood our community our city our state our country\n\nthis has been our story the american story since the beginning of our nation and it is still going strong today now for many americans including a lot of you here serving our country has included serving in our armed forces\n\npeople are starting to call out their services!\n\nthere is no greater service or sacrifice and we are grateful to our men and women in uniform to their families and our veterans every single day but what so great is that national service can take many different forms and it something that i believe in so deeply that every stage of our lives gives us the chance from grade school through grandparenthood to find a way to give back\n\nweve got folks here today from americorps which my husband created back in 1993 and ill tell you to this day it is one of his proudest achievements because very day americorps volunteers are out there theyre building houses responding to natural disasters helping people with disabilities find jobs find safe places to live and next week on october 7th americorps will celebrate a major milestone their onemillionth member ill tell you bill is really excited about this and so am i and by the way americorps has one of the best swearing in pledges i have ever heard here how it starts i will get things done for america isnt that great i think we should make that a national slogan\n\nnow we also have folks here today from city year which is part of americorps and every day theyre working with students who are risk of dropping out of school theyre tutoring and mentoring and running after school clubs  all to help young people really discover how capable they really are and to be empowered and to stay in school im really grateful to them\n\nwe also have people here today from the peace corps which represents the best of america to the world peace corps volunteers are teaching english in kosovo staffing health centers in nicaragua supporting farmers in nepal distributing malaria nets in uganda both as first lady and as secretary of state i got to see the results of their work first hand they are making the world a healthier more prosperous and more peaceful place now maybe not all of you have been a part of one of these programs but i know you serve in different ways\n\nmaybe you volunteer through your school or with your church or synagogue maybe you find through faithbased opportunities as i did when i was a teenager service opportunities because for many americans service is part of our faith my running mate tim kaine volunteered in honduras with jesuits as a young man and it changed his life or maybe your whole family volunteers together bill and chelsea and i every holiday season would work at a food bank back in arkansas however you serve it feels good doesnt it to be part of something bigger than ourselves to take our time and labor and put it towards something good that can happen in our country and the world\n\nand you know something very interesting service makes us happier it makes us healthier and there are studies proving that it not just how we feel theyve actually followed people it can also help us find our next job or our true calling in life it a smart way to use our greatest asset in life our people and service does something important for us as a society too often we americans can become separated from each other and i think a lot of people are feeling this way during this election\n\nit easy to surround ourselves with only those that think like us talk like us look like us read the same news as us that understandable to an extent but it comes with a cost because it magnifies our differences which then makes it harder to put those differences aside when our community or country needs us there arent many places where people of all ages all races all backgrounds all beliefs come together in common cause but service is one of them and that one of the reasons i think it so valuable because in addition to the good work it does it helps us reconnect with each other to feel more a part of our shared american life\n\ni believe that one of the jobs of president is to encourage more service to help more americans answer president kennedy call you know it ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country\n\nbut sometimes it hard to figure out how do you make a difference especially with everything else going on in our lives and too often volunteering becomes something only people with lots of time and financial security can do but that not how it should be everyone should be able to contribute\n\nso what if we as a country made it easier for everybody to do that for everybody to give back what if we created more service opportunities for americans of all ages invested in programs that work and encouraged entrepreneurs to add a social component to their businesses what if we strengthened the culture of service in america so it wasnt just something that we did one day a year but it became a regular part of our lives i think that would reflect our values and would tap into something so great about america\n\ni talk a lot about how america is an exceptional nation were not exceptional just because of the size of our military or the size of our economy were exceptional because of the generosity and ingenuity of our people\n\nway back nearly 200 years ago a frenchman came to the united states his name was alexis de tocqueville he was travelling around trying to figure out what is this new place called america they fought a revolution who are they and he saw how we had set up our government and we had three branches and everything that our founders really put into place but the thing that made the biggest impression on him was our spirit of volunteerism that made a democracy as diverse and ambitious as ours possible if im elected president this fall i want to build on that strength by making a major push in support of more national service so here what i plan to do\n\nfirst let triple americorps that was the goal of my friend and the great senator ted kennedy it was laid out in a law named in his honor the edward m kennedy serve america act it finally time we get it done every year there are hundreds of thousands of more applications for americorps than there are spots in the program so if we grow the program from 75000 annual members to 250000 were going to give more people who already want to serve the chance to do so\n\nthen i want to double the college scholarships that americorps members earn through their service and i want to find ways for more students to get college credit for service because i know too many talented committed young people who pass up serving with americorps because with their student loans they cant afford it so let lighten that burden if you do national service we will begin a program to forgive your loans because you are giving back to your country and let keep working to the ultimate goal of making it possible for any american to serve full time if they want to\n\nnow second let grow the peace corps since president kennedy launched it 55 years ago it given nearly a quarter of a million americans the experience of a lifetime and it fostered friendship and cooperation between americans and people in more than 100 nations weve got to do more of that in the world today we need more americans of all ages around the world showing our values serving people so let make it possible for more americans to be a part of this extraordinary program\n\nthird let expand service opportunities for people of all ages right now let be fair the younger generation is way ahead on this ive talked to so many young people who are deeply thoughtful about how your lives impact others and the world service isnt just something to do to check a box before graduation it really is woven into your lives and many who are just getting started in your careers say that having a social impact is more important to you than getting a job that yes may pay a salary but doesnt give you any meaning or purpose in your lives\n\nnow i also want to get older americans more involved service isnt something only students and young people do i know that so i intend to make sure that 10 percent of americorps slots go to americans over the age of 55 let give people an encore opportunity after theyve ended their formal careers so they can apply a lifetime of knowledge and experience to a stronger community\n\nand finally i want to create a new means for people to serve in serious meaningful ways without a full time commitment americorps is a full time commitment the peace corps is a full time commitment the armed forces are a full time commitment but the armed forces has another model the reserves  right it gives people the chance to make a high impact contribution while still building careers and pursuing their dreams in other ways so let do something like that in the civilian space let call it the national service reserve\n\nand here the idea if you join the national service reserve you will receive some basic training just like you would in the military reserves and then when your city or state needs you youll get the call say a natural disaster strikes and the red cross needs all hands on deck or maybe like the crisis in flint and clean water has to be distributed every day to a lot of families or maybe your city launches a major public health campaign to reduce drug abuse or promote mental health you will then be sent into action now some of these assignments maybe just be for a few days a month some might be longer term but they will directly address a vital need in your own community\n\nand one of the other advantages is you can help meet that need while still being a fulltime student having a job taking care of your family you wont have to make service your only priority our goal is 5 million people spread across all 50 states and we will have an open door to people of all ages but we want to put a special focus on people under 30 whove said again and again they want to have a bigger impact in their communities but they cant leave their jobs understandably well work with governors and mayors republicans and democrats because i want this to be a true bipartisan publicprivate partnership\n\ni also want to include businesses colleges and universities who have unique resources to offer and because we want workers and students to know that as they make this contribution their schools and their employers will have their backs i really think a national service reserve could make a difference for cities and states there so much work to be done and so many people who want to help do it so let bridge that divide get people working together in ways that can help communities\n\nnow i dont think youll hear anything about this from my opponent and you know what i think that a shame because national service has always been a bipartisan goal of course president kennedy started the peace corps and my husband started americorps  but president nixon signed the domestic volunteer service act president george hw bush created the white house office of national service and both president george w bush and president obama have been huge champions of service this should be something that we all can get behind and when you listen to what being said in this campaign it can be discouraging right it can seem hard to find any common ground so it makes it even more important that we come together where whenever we can now i am well aware that candidates dont usually focus on national service in the final stretch of a hotly fought presidential election some might say well hey my gosh youve only got 39 days to go why arent you just out there beating up on your opponent and doing everything to get the vote out and all the rest of it well ill do that but  ive been thinking about this for a long time and i did not want this campaign to end without talking about it because it means a lot to me im trying to end the campaign focusing on issues that are really close to my heart  and this is one of them\n\nthank you!\n\nfor me service is really all about fulfilling the instruction of my methodist faith and you can see part of the creed i like to follow behind me do all the good you can in all the ways you can in all the places you can at all the times you can to all the people you can as long as ever you can now ive carried those words with me ever since i heard them as a little girl and it an idea that really got into my head and my heart but you know what kept me going are the people that ive met and in a country founded on liberty and equality i cant think of a more important notion than every one of us is valuable we all deserve respect we all should listen to each other we all can make our mark on the world and when we come together in common purpose we can do so much more than we could ever do on our own\n\nthat why tronger together is more than just a slogan it a course of action so here what i want to do i want you to hear me pledge that this will be a vital aspect of my presidency and i want you to help me bring our nation together  to solve our problems strengthen our communities to join with people across america who care about service because this speaks to both what is great and good about the united states america is great because we are good there are lots of examples we are going to be putting examples up on my website of people who have served and who are inspirations but i want everybody here to know that it can be done we can do more and we can provide the opportunities to enlist more people\n\nthere are so many examples in this community and communities across america  39 days left this is the choice do we lift each other up or do we tear each other down do we listen and respect each other or do we scapegoat point fingers and insult each other well ill tell you what side im going to be on and with your help were going to demonstrate on november 8th what kind of country we really are\n\nthank you and god bless you!
24,hello grand valley! thank you! thank you\nit is great to be back in western michigan thank you are there any lakers here\n\noh my gosh i am so thrilled to be here i want to thank the president of this great university tom haas the faculty the staff the students i want to thank brandon dillon the chair of the michigan democratic party and i especially really want to thank you for sending debbie stabenow to the united states senate\n\ni have also the great personal experience and privilege of having worked with debbie gotten to know her become a friend of hers and i am so excited at the possibility that i\ll be able to work with her again but i want you to know this  and i really really hope you\ll tell folks because there is no more dedicated effective member of the united states senate than debbie stabenow\n\nshe fights for all of you every day but she does it with that smile that never leaves her face and she brings people together who are on opposite sides of issues because she just keeps talking and don\t we need more of that in washington where people actually talk and listen to each other so it\ wonderful to be with all of you and to be introduced by debbie\n\nare you ready to vote tomorrow michigan are you ready to help get your friends to vote tomorrow that is clearly the right answer because we have a really important election tomorrow\n\nthe choice in this election could not be clearer and i know that for many people you\ve gone back and forth you\ve thought about what to do and i really respect that but let me say this let me say this this election is basically between division and unity in our country\n\nit\ between strong and steady leadership or a loose cannon who could put everything at risk it is between an economy that works for everyone or one that is even more stacked for those at the top and i want each and every one of you to be thinking through about all the issues that you care about because although my name and my opponents name will be on the ballot those issues and those values are on the ballot as well\n\nand as you think about what you care about and what you want your future to look like you have to recognize this is a consequential election i have been privileged to know a lot of our presidents over the past decades and people who ran for president i was privileged to know as a college student gerald ford\n\nin fact i had an internship with the house republican conference committee which he headed after my junior year in college so when i say i\ve gotten to know a lot of our presidents and people who\ve run for president it goes back a ways and here\ what i want you to understand i didn\t agree with everything they did or said even the democrats we had differences and politics and policies and sometimes on principle but i never doubted i never doubted that they were fit to serve as our president and commanderinchief\n\nthat\ why this election is so different and it\ why so many republicans have spoken out to endorse me and support me and who have taken very courageous stands against the nominee of their own party because they believe that we must put country ahead of party when it comes to this election\n\ni was at kent state in ohio last week and i was introduced by a gentleman by the name of bruce blair and mr blair had served in the air force he was a young officer assigned to be what was called a launch officer that meant he served his time every day sitting in a bunker where the controls for launching nuclear weapons were housed and his job  imagine the responsibility a young air force officer in his twenties waiting to hear whether or not an order is given for him to launch nuclear weapons\n\nand bruce blair explained that there is no appeal from a president\ order to do that the joint chiefs of our military forces can\t say no don\t do it there\ no veto from congress or anyone else and the time between the order being given and the actual launch is four minutes\n\nso after watching this election mr blair began contacting others who had served in this incredibly responsible position to share his concerns about what he was hearing and seeing and several dozen of them  i\d never met them before  several dozen of them wrote a letter explaining why they could never support donald trump to be our commanderinchief\n\nthe awesome responsibility that is housed in one person is something i want you to think about between now and the time you vote because i will pledge to you that i will exercise the greatest care and responsibility in all of the powers invested in the office of the presidency\n\ni also want to pose to you a contrast in visions did any of you see the debates first of all i did stand for four and a half hours with donald trump on the stage proving conclusively i have the stamina to be president\n\nbut i have to say in addition to that there were so many things that he said that of course i sometimes was surprised by but the theme that ran through much of his rhetoric was the presentation of a dark and divisive vision for america now i have to tell you i know we\ve got problems i\ve spent 18 months traveling around our country talking to  by now  hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people hearing what\ on people\ minds we\ve got challenges but america\ always had challenges and since when do we become pessimistic and not able to think about what we can do to overcome those challenges and solve those problems together\n\ni often didn\t recognize the country that donald trump was describing because from my perspective looking back at our history we have a tremendous opportunity ahead of us and you can vote for a hopeful inclusive bighearted america that will set the stage for an even better future\n\nand i want to say especially to the students who are here  i really believe that america\ best days are still ahead of us if we reach for them together\n\nmake no mistake our core values are being tested in this election but my faith in our future has never been stronger last night in manchester new hampshire i was introduced by mr khizr khan\n\nsome of you know or remember that his son captain khan serving in the united states army was killed serving in iraq and like at the democratic convention this summer he spoke powerfully about what america means to him and how we have to defend our values and our constitution that are the envy of the rest of the world people look at us with yearning they see that we are a beacon of freedom hope and opportunity for people right here at home\n\nwhen i heard mr khan speak at the convention and i heard him again last night i was so touched because what he said exhibited a love of our country he said that when he started hearing donald trump speak and all of the things he said about so many people not only muslims but africanamericans and latinos and pows and women and so many people  when he heard it he couldn\t help but think as he walked around his house  he has a room where his son\ medals  he got the bronze star he got the purple heart  the flag that was draped on his coffin  is respectfully presented in the box that he was given it in and he thought to himself would there be any room for my son in donald trump\ america\n\nthink about that for a minute because every single one of us has something to contribute to this great country we are already great but we can be greater and we will be greater\n\ni love our country and i believe in the american people and i know there is nothing we can\t do when we make up our minds throughout our history generations of americans have risen together to meet the tests of their time they defended democracy they built the greatest middle class the world has ever known they marched for civil rights and voting rights for workers\ rights and union rights for lgbt rights rights for people with disabilities\n\nand now now we\ve got to come together and we have to prove we can meet the challenges of our time we\ve got to get the economy working for everybody not just those at the top\n\nif you believe as i do that america thrives when the middle class thrives then you have to vote tomorrow\n\nwe are going to make the biggest investment in good paying jobs since world war ii jobs in infrastructure our roads our bridges our tunnels our ports our airports our water systems\n\nthese are jobs we need doing in american and these are jobs that cannot be exported they\ve got to be done right here in michigan and across our country\n\nand we are going to invest in new jobs in advanced manufacturing i am not one of these folks who think we just can\t make it in america anymore and i\ll tell you why because if we have a plan and we actually commit to fulfilling that plan we can lead the world in precision machining in 3d printing we\re not competing for lowwage jobs we\re competing with germany for high manufacturing high skilled jobs\n\nand we are going to have clean renewable energy jobs as a way to fight climate change as you heard my opponent chose to make many of his products overseas and as i pointed out in the last debate he buys cheap chinese steel and aluminum instead of good american steel made by american steel workers\n\nhe\ gone all over this country and he\ gone all over michigan talking about how he\ gonna really get more jobs and he\ going to bring back what used to be there well i\ll tell you what look at his record don\t just listen to his rhetoric\n\nbecause i have a different idea we\re going to invest in america again and for everybody who is frustrated and anxious and maybe even angry because they feel left out left behind that america\ not working the way it should  i understand that i understand that i represented upstate new york for eight years and i saw first hand a lot of the loss of jobs and factories picking up and moving out\n\nbut i also realized that anger is not a plan you\ve got to come together and figure out what is it we\re gonna do to bring new jobs back and create more opportunity for people\n\nand i\ll just tell you that i believe that we\ve got to defend the american worker\ right to organize and bargain for better wages and benefits\n\nwe\re gonna get incomes rising here in western michigan and across this state and we\re also gonna do more to help small business my dad was a small businessman he worked really hard he ran a printing plant that printed fabrics for draperies and i would from time to time help him out you take a silkscreen you put it down on the long table you pour the paint in you do the squeegee you pick it up  it wasn\t automated we were the automaters  and you\d go all the way down to one table you\d go to the other table so i know how hard people in small business work\n\nand i also know something else donald trump made a lot of money off the backs of small business people and contractors by stiffing them and refusing to pay his bills and i have said i am sure glad my dad never got a contract from donald trump because we could not have afforded that\n\nbut it\ not just enough to grow the economy we have to make it fairer and if you believe we need a fairer economy then you have to vote i think the best antidote for whatever ails a person is a good job i believe in hard work that\ how i was raised but i also believe that if you work hard and you work full time you shouldn\t still be in poverty at the end of the year and i\m gonna raise the national minimum wage\n\nand one of the things i\ve heard all over america especially from young families really from all families but particularly young families is how hard it is to do so many of the things that are expected  like where do you find affordable quality childcare in lots of states it\ more expensive than college tuition we\re gonna get the cost of childcare down we\re going to have a paid family leave program so that when you have a sick relative or you\re sick you won\t lose your job\n\ni saw the folks over there holding up the tim kaine sign and i really appreciate that thank you thank you i got to tell you  tim and i were in pittsburgh last month with a big crowd and we couldn\t get everybody in like today so tim went out to say hello to people and he saw a woman holding a baby probably about three years old and he stopped to talk to her and she said i came here because i wanted to tell you and to tell hillary clinton what happened to me she said that i had my baby it was a hard labor and delivery and i needed some time off and i called by boss and said the doctors want me to take some time off and so i won\t be in for  i think she said two weeks  and they said ok you\re fired\n\nthat is legal in america still and what that does is to say that  wait a minute do we really value children do we really value families and we\ve got to have a system that is fair to employers and fair to employees because you got to be able to balance work and family in today\ america\n\nand then finally i think it is way past time to guarantee equal pay for women\ work\n\nand you know i gotta say  this always gets a huge round of applause as you can tell  but this is not just a woman\ issue it\ a family issue if you have a wife a mother a sister a daughter who\ in the work force you want her to be paid what she deserves to be paid to help you and your family\n\njust about everything i\ve said so far my opponent disagrees with and whenever i talk about affordable childcare and paid family leave and equal pay  he says i\m playing the woman\ card and you know what i say if that\ the case then deal me in\n\nand here\ what else i want you to know it\ fair to ask how are you going to pay for that that\ not only fair that\ necessary to ask because i want to be a good steward of your tax dollars just as i expect you\re a good steward of your family budget i have proposed a very simple formula i will not raise taxes on anyone making less than 250000 a year\n\nand for small businesses we\re gonna cut your taxes because i know a lot of small businesses need that kind of tax relief so instead we\re going where the money is to the millionaires and the billionaires and the big corporations\n\nand that is in stark contrast to what donald trump has proposed his whole economic plan is cut trillions of dollars in taxes from millionaires and billionaires and corporations that is trickledown economics on steroids i profoundly disagree i think the way you build an economy is from the middle out and the bottom up not from the top down\n\nwhen you think about it donald hasn\t paid anything for 20 years he\ paid zero to support our military our vets pell grants for students here at grand valley our highways  and i am still pondering i am just pondering how anybody can lose a billion dollars in one year\n\nespecially when you\re running casinos i do not understand that but that will be one of the mysteries in this campaign because he\ not going to release his tax returns now and the time you start voting and that sort of suggests there must be something really terrible in those tax returns because everybody else for more than 40 years has released them\n\nso we\ll still wonder but what we know is his economic approach will cost us jobs not create jobs and we can\t afford that we need to keep building we have recovered from the worst financial crash since the great depression but we\re not where we need to be yet the last thing we need is a failed economic policy coming back in and pushing us back down and depriving people of the jobs that we want to create\n\nand if you believe all of our kids should have good schools and good teachers no matter what zip code they live in then you have to vote\n\nand if you believe college should be affordable you have to vote i\ve got to say i am proud of the campaign that bernie sanders and i ran it was a campaign about ideas and issues not insults and when it was over we actually got together what a novel idea we wanted to figure out how we can work together to actually produce on some of the goals that we both shared so bernie and i worked on this plan together\n\npublic colleges and universities should be tuitionfree for everyone who makes less than a 125000 a year and they should be debtfree for everyone else because nobody should go into debt and if you have gone into debt if you\re among the millions of americans who are struggling  as i see some hands pointing in the air  paying back your student debt we are going to help you pay it down and pay it off\n\nit makes no sense at all we have interest rates that are really low right now buy a car for what 1 or 2 percent you can buy a house for 34 percent there are so many people who are paying 8 10 12 higher  8 10 12 percent interest  how much twelve point seven fourteen point one i got to tell you friends that is outrageous the federal government should not be making money off of sending kids to college\n\ni can\t wait to roll up my sleeves with debbie and bernie and we\re gonna get to work right after this election if i am fortunate enough to win\n\nlook working for children and families has been the cause of my life but it\ never been more important than it is right now and that has to be our mission together doing all we can to help every american and especially every young american and every child in america to have the chance to live up to their godgiven potential i will wake up every single day in the white house trying to figure out what i can do to make that a reality for you\n\nso after tomorrow the work will begin and one of the highest priorities that i feel an obligation to address is how we bring our country together a lot of people say we\ve got to heal our country or as the bible says repair the breach because we have so much divisiveness right now we\ve got to start listening to each other respecting each other i know it is unusual i admit for somebody running for president especially the day before an election but i\ve been saying this for months to say that we need more of two things right now\n\nwe need more love and kindness in america\n\ni don\t know about you i don\t know about you but i bet everyone of us has received a kindness and maybe i hope we\ve all extended one i am standing here today because my mother who was abandoned by her parents rejected by her grandparents went to work at the age of 14 as a maid and a babysitter was extended kindness not by those who should have loved her but by others the first grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch who began bringing extra food the woman whose house she went to work in who knew that my mother wanted to go to high school she would have been a freshman in high school when she had to leave her grandparents\ home and she got this job and that woman said i know you want to go to high school if you get up early and you get your chores done you can go to high school but you\ll have to come back because we\ll need you in the late afternoon\n\nnow that may sound harsh to say to a 14year old but to my mother it was a gift i tell you this because we all have to start thinking about how we want to be treated and what that means about how we treat others and ã\x89\n\nthere\ a version of the golden rule in every major religion and it is a reminder that every one of us gets knocked down the question as my mother would say is are you gonna get back up and for people in our country who feel like they\ve been knocked down and nobody cares nobody\ paying attention here\ what i want you to know if you give me the honor of being your president i\m gonna do everything i can to get this country and everybody in it back up on our feet moving forward together\n\nbecause i want to be a president for all americans\n\ndemocrats republicans independents not just the people who support me everybody in this country because i believe with all my heart each of us has a role to play in building a better future so let\ take that first step tomorrow if you don\t know where you\re supposed to vote go to iwillvotecom  you can get all the information you need if you want to help us bringing out the vote here in western michigan in the last 24 36 hours you can still sign up to volunteer go to hillaryclintoncom or you can text join247246 or stop by one of our offices we would be really excited to see you because when your kids and grandkids ask what you did in 2016 when everything was on the line i hope you\ll be able to say that you voted for a better stronger fairer america\n\nan america where we build bridges not wallsand an america where we prove that yes love trumps hate\n\nthank you all so much
25,thank you thank you all hello everyone it great to be here at unc greensboro i want to thank martha for that wonderful introduction it means so much to have her here along with her wonderful daughter sara and her mother barbara and the story she told is really one that motivates me every day because it is kids like sara that led me to politics in the first place to try to make our country and our world better for them so to see sara grown up and thriving is very special and your whole family support really means the world to me thank you martha sara barbara\ni have to say it great to be back on the campaign trail as you may know i recently had a cough that turned out to be pneumonia i tried to power through it but even i had to admit that maybe a few days of rest would do me good and im not great at taking it easy even under ordinary circumstances but with just two months to go until election day sitting at home was pretty much the last place i wanted to be\n\nbut it turns out having a few days to myself was actually a gift i talked with some old friends i spent time with our very sweet dogs i did some thinking the campaign trail doesnt really encourage reflection and it important to sit with your thoughts every now and then and that did help me reconnect with what this whole campaign is about\n\npeople like me  were lucky when im under the weather  now i just want to have a conversation and other people can wave their arms and their signs but i want you to think with me for a minute about how i certainly feel lucky when im under the weather i can afford to take a few days off millions of americans cant they either go to work sick or they lose a paycheck dont they\n\nlots of americans still dont even have insurance or they do but it too expensive for them to actually use so they toss back some tylenols they chug orange juice and they hope that the cough or the virus goes away on its own\n\nlots of working parents cant afford childcare which in many states costs as much as college tuition so for millions of moms and dads if they get sick there no backup theyre on their own arent they\n\nthat the story for too many people still in america when illness strikes or an accident happens you feel youre on your own if you lose your job or cant afford college youre on your own if your aging parent starts needing more help and you dont know what to do youre on your own\n\nlife events like these are catastrophic for some families but mere bumps in the road for others i have met so many people living on a razor edge one illness away from losing their job one paycheck away from losing their home and that goes against everything we stand for as americans because some things should not come down to luck some things should be within reach for everyone no matter what like financial security like affordable health care like the peace of mind that comes with knowing that if something goes wrong your family will be okay and above all the knowledge that no matter what your president is fighting for you and will always have your back\n\nthat right there that why i got into this race i am running for everyone working hard to support their families everyone who been knocked down but gets back up the factory workers on their feet all day and the nurses looking after patients all night im running for young people like so many of you here who dream of changing our world for the better and for all the parents and grandparents supporting those dreams by dedicating every dollar they can spare to your education\n\nim running for the lgbt teenager here in north carolina who sees your governor sign a bill legalizing discrimination and suddenly feels like a secondclass citizen and if anyone wonders what the costs of discrimination are just ask the people and businesses of north carolina look at what happening with the ncaa and the acc this is where bigotry leads and we cant afford it  not here not anywhere else in america\n\nim running for women like janelle turner back in may of last year janelle was diagnosed with breast cancer she went through nearly six months of very tough treatments last october she brought her eightyearold daughter to one of our rallies in iowa and they made a huge sign that read thirteenth chemo yesterday three more hear me roar! wouldnt you want to meet the woman behind that sign well i sure did so we got talking and weve stayed in touch she keeps promising me shell see me at the inauguration and i tell her ill keep working to get there but shed better be there too\n\nim running for her and all the mothers and fathers trying to get and stay healthy so they can be there for their kids but perhaps most of all im running for those kids standing up for children has been the work of my life as a lawyer with the children defense fund as first lady in arkansas in the white house as a senator i have fought for kids housed in adult jails kids who have been neglected and abused kids who couldnt get health insurance because of preexisting conditions kids with disabilities so they could go to school you heard today from someone ive known for a long time now grown up and a lovely young woman anastasia somoza i learned from my family and my methodist faith that we are each called to do all the good we can for all the people we can for however long we can and to me that means making sure all our children have the chance to live up to their godgiven potentials\n\nso when i meet a little girl in nevada terrified that her parents are going to be deported it hits me right in the gut when i meet a little boy in flint michigan who cant drink the water at home or in school because it poisoned with lead that gets me going all i want to do is get to work making things better for them\n\nthat why i care so much about national security too i want to give our kids a safer world to me that means a world with strong allies more friends fewer enemies and fewer nuclear weapons it also means leading the fight against climate change so we can leave our kids a health planet\n\nmy opponent in this race disagrees with me on every one of these fronts just a few days ago he said that if another country troops taunted ours  not fired at them but taunted them just taunts  hed responded  he would respond by blowing them out of the water he would start a war over that that is just one more reason my friends why the stakes in this election are as high as any in our lifetimes\n\nive been involved in politics in one way or another for many years it is not an easy business it can get rough and ive built up some defenses when it comes to public service im better at the ervice part than the public part but this is why i do it and this is who im in it for to make life better for children and families and that what this race has always been about for me\n\nwell now were in the final stretch there are just 54 days till election day just 54 days till the most consequential vote of our lifetimes and just a little more than a month until early voting starts here in north carolina let make these days count particularly here because you know what your governor and legislature tried to do  make it harder for young people to vote harder for people of color harder for people with disabilities harder for the elderly there cant be any more motivation than that to make sure every young person every person of color every person with a disability every older person turns out and votes\n\nso in these final days let try to tune out all the chatter and the nonstop analysis that doesnt often have much to do with what the next president has to do to create good jobs to create opportunity to make it possible for every young person to afford to go to college or get the skills that you need for the jobs of the future let talk about what really matters\n\nand here my promise to you im going to close my campaign the way i began my career and the way i will serve as your president should you give me that great honor  focused on opportunities for kids and fairness for families\n\nnext week ill go to philadelphia to talk about challenges facing our young people in florida to focus on building an economy that welcomes everyone contributions including people with disabilities then ill be back here in north carolina to meet with more working families from now until november 8th everywhere i go im going to talk about my ideas for our country my campaign has rolled out detailed plans in 38 different policy areas  yes somebody actually counted everything from reining in wall street to creating goodpaying jobs to fighting alzheimer to supporting people with autism you see i have this oldfashioned notion that if youre running for president you should say what you plan to do how youre going to get it done and how youre going to pay for it you can read it all on my website hillaryclintoncom we even put it in a new book called you guessed it stronger together get a copy of it because it tells you everything tim kaine and i intend to do\n\nnow like a lot of women i have a tendency to overprepare i sweat the details whether were talking about the exact level of lead in the water in flint or how many north carolina kids are in early enrichment programs or the precise interest rate on your student loans right down to the decimal because you know what it not a detail if it your kid it not a detail if it your family it a big deal and it should be a big deal to your president\n\nnow i confess ill never be the showman my opponent is and that okay with me just look at  look at the show he put on with dr oz today but i am going to deliver for you and your family just like i did for sarah all those years ago with the children health insurance program that gave her the chance to be the extraordinary young woman she is and ill tell you something else people accuse me of all kinds of things you probably have seen that but nobody ever accuses me of quitting and i will never give up ill never walk away no matter how tough the going gets im actually asking americans to hold me accountable for my ideas and hold my opponent accountable for his\n\nwe dont need a president who says the minimum wage is too high we need a president who knows that americans deserve a raise to get to a living wage we dont need a president who wants to take away people health coverage we need a president who wants everyone to have quality affordable health care and we dont need a president who apparently thinks only married people deserve paid leave and only mothers stay home with kids we dont need someone who rushes out a halfbaked plan just weeks before an election after decades of ignoring or putting down working moms we need a president who has spent years fighting for these issues who has a plan to support all families in all their various shapes ask yourself which candidate you can count on to be on your side respect your family stand up and fight for you and your kids\n\nthat is who you should vote for on november 8th because as michelle obama said in her fabulous speech at the democratic convention when we go to the polls this november the real choice isnt between democrat or republican it about who will have the power to shape our children for the next four years of their lives it also about the kind of country we want to be and what we want to leave behind for future generations people have to decide are we going to make our economy work for everyone or just those at the top are we going to bring people together or pit americans against each other and rip our country apart are we going to work with our allies to keep us safe or are we going to put a loose cannon in charge who would risk everything generations of americans have worked so hard to build\n\nnow i have a lot of confidence in the american people and in our country my opponent keeps running us down saying were weak a disaster an embarrassment every

26,hello kent state! and happy halloween everybody! it great to be back in ohio  even if even if the world series is making life very stressful for cubs fans everywhere\ni want to thank bruce blair for that introduction and for his service to our nation i think every american should hear your story over the next 8 days before they vote i also want to thank everyone who was part of the preprogram in particular let me thank senator sherrod brown such a great senator my dear friend and great congressman tim ryan state representative john boccieri state representative kathleen clyde and let me thank the kent clarks the acapella group that sang during the preprogram!\n\nmy friends we are about to enter the final week of this election so i wanted to come back to ohio one of the most competitive and consequential battlegrounds in the country to talk about what at stake in this election but let me start with this im sure a lot of you may be asking what this new email story is about and why in the world the fbi would decide to jump into an election with no evidence of any wrongdoing with just days to go that a good question!\n\nand first of all for those of you who are concerned about my using personal email i understand and as ive said im not making excuses i said it was a mistake and i regret it and now they apparently want to look at emails of one of my staffers and by all means they should look at them and i am sure they will reach the same conclusion they did when they looked at my emails for the last year there is no case here and they said it wasnt even a close call and i think most people have decided a long time ago what they think about all of this\n\nnow what people are focused on is choosing the next president and commanderinchief of the united states of america and did any of you see the debates well i think it was important because i had a chance to talk about my 30 years of public service and my plans for our country and then people could weigh that against what my opponent has done and said i am running against a man who says he doesnt understand why we cant use nuclear weapons he actually said then why are we making them and he wants more countries to have nuclear weapons japan south korea even saudi arabia imagine nuclear weapons smack in the middle of the middle east\n\nand if youre telling yourself hell surround himself with smart people wholl stop these crazy ideas remember this when he asked who he consults on foreign policy donald trump said he didnt need to consult because he said and i quote i have a very good brain he said he knows more about isis than our generals do no he does not and of course the people donald trump has had around him include two men whose activities are reportedly being investigated for their ties to russia  vladimir putin and putin allies\n\nso in these last days let not get distracted from the real choice in this election and the consequences for your future i started saying last june i believe that donald trump has proven himself temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president and commanderinchief and ive got to tell you i did not take any pleasure in saying that i have known i have known for years now people who ran for president republicans and democrats and i had my differences with republicans and even with democrats but i never doubted their fitness to serve donald trump is different that as serious as it gets\n\nso today i want to talk about our national security because when the election is over and people wake up on november 9th we will have picked the person who will carry the responsibility for all these weighty decisions and that should really convince anyone how high the stakes really are in this election and i just want to focus on three of the most crucial questions facing the next president can you be trusted to command our nuclear arsenal and make literally life and death decisions about war and peace how do you handle a crisis and do you know the difference between our allies and our adversaries\n\nwell start with nuclear weapons now i know there are some who will say that any discussion of this topic could be fearmongering but i dont think so and in part of what you just heard from bruce blair when dozens of retired nuclear launch officers publicly state that donald trump should and i quote not have his finger on the button then this is a topic that cant be avoided and as ive said donald has repeatedly suggested that more countries should have nuclear weapons he must not realize or care that the more nuclear material there is in the world the more likely terrorists are to get their hands on it  or that someone will miscalculate and start a war that cant be stopped and when a few more countries go nuclear their neighbors will feel pressure to do so as well\n\none of the reasons i worked so hard to impose sanctions on iran so that we could get them to the negotiating table was so we would not have a nuclear arms race in the middle east and i am proud that we put a lid on iran nuclear weapons program but even the prospect of an actual nuclear war doesnt seem to bother donald trump good luck enjoy yourselves folks was what he had to say about a potential nuclear conflict in asia\n\ni wonder if he knows that a single nuclear warhead can kill millions of people these are weapons today far more powerful than the bombs that destroyed hiroshima and nagasaki during world war ii\n\nto talk so casually so cavalierly about mass annihilation is truly appalling president ronald reagan once said  and he worked hard for arms control and i admired what he did working with the soviet union  and he once said he feared and this is a quote from president reagan ome fool or some maniac or some accident triggering the kind of war that is the end of the line for all of us that has been the fear and the commitment of democratic and republican presidents since the dawn of the atomic age\n\nso what would he think about donald trump who says he wants to be and i quote unpredictable about using the most powerful weapons ever produced and here the thing with nuclear weapons  as bruce told you when the president gives the order that it there no veto for congress no veto by the joint chiefs the officers in the silos have no choice but to fire and that can take as little as four minutes that why all those retired launch officers stepped forward and said donald trump should never be put in charge of our nuclear arsenal\n\nearlier you heard from one of them bruce blair and his story is worth remembering in 1973 bruce was a young military officer working in an underground bunker in montana his job was to launch as many as 50 nuclear weapons if the president ever gave the order then one night in october as the united states and the soviet union squared off over an escalating conflict in the middle east the emergency message he had trained for arrived prepare for nuclear war like other american officers in bunkers and submarines and bombers around the world bruce and his colleagues started the process because that was their duty they unlocked the safe took out the launch codes and the keys and then strapped into their chairs to brace for the shockwaves that would come if a russian warhead detonated above them then they waited for the final order from the president thankfully it never came but when bruce looks at donald trump and sees his hairtrigger temper and he thinks about what it felt like inside that bunker that night as ive said many times a man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons\n\nand that brings me to the second question i think voters should pose to both candidates how do you handle a crisis weve seen in this campaign that donald trump loses his cool at the slightest provocation when he gotten a tough question from a reporter when he challenged in a debate when he sees a protestor at a rally when he confronted with his own words so imagine him in the oval office facing a real crisis imagine his advisors afraid to tell him what he doesnt want to hear racing against his legendarily short attention span to lay out lifeanddeath choices too complex to be reduced to a single tweet and then imagine him plunging us into a war because somebody got under his very thin skin\n\nnow thankfully he never been in a position where he had to help make lifeanddeath decisions for our country but there was one national crisis where we did get a good look at how donald trump handles himself donald is a new yorker and his finest moment in this campaign was when he defended new york against ted cruz attacks in a debate and then he invoked the days after 9/11 when new yorkers really came together and took care of each other and i couldnt agree more that why it was so upsetting to learn what donald was actually doing on 9/11 after the world watched with horror as the twin towers fell he called in to a new york tv station and even on that horrible day when thousands of people lost their lives he couldnt stop himself from pointing out that now because the towers had fallen a building he owned was now the tallest in lower manhattan what kind of a person brags at a moment like that ill tell you someone who should never set foot in the oval office and serve as commander in chief\n\nfor me i take this very personally my friends because i was one of new york senators along with chuck schumer on 9/11 he and i were on the ground the very next day meeting with the governor the mayor emergency officials and i will never forget the sight of ground zero the thick smoke made it hard to breathe or see some of the firefighters and other first responders we met had been on duty nonstop since the planes hit the towers they had all lost friends in a makeshift command center we were briefed on the damage and it was clear we were going to need a lot of help to recover new york and we were going to have to really make it our absolute mission to not only rebuild new york but to keep america safe\n\nthat what i did for eight years as a senator i never stopped fighting to keep our country safer and to ensure that first responders got the medical care they needed and i think it important to reflect on what each of us has done in moments like that because a lot of the crises that come at a president are not predicted they happen ill tell you a quick story it was after presidentelect obama asked me to be secretary of state but before the inauguration and i got a call to come to an emergency meeting in the white house in the situation room and the new obama national security team was on one side of table and the outgoing bush national security team was on the other side and the bush administration had gotten credible intelligence that there was going to be an attack at our inauguration\n\nso even before we were sworn in to do our jobs we were faced with helping to make such a consequential decision it really matters what your experience has what your values are whether you can be counted on to make that decision you learn a lot about people in moments like that and as i sat there with the pressure on having to think through in my own head how we evaluated this intelligence how we did everything we could to preserve our inauguration of our first african american president on the mall in washington\n\nwe made the decision to go forward obviously some of you might have been there but we also did everything we could to double our efforts to find out about the intelligence and to secure the hundreds of thousands of people who would be there so you have to ask yourself in a crisis who would you trust who will listen to good advice keep a level head and make the right call because that the person you want as our president and commander in chief\n\nnow let get to the third question for all of the voters to consider about each of us do you know the difference between our allies and our adversaries now this may seem like an easy question if you got it on an exam i think youd be able to answer it but apparently it hard for donald he has picked fights with our friends i mean the president of mexico the british prime minister the german chancellor pretty much the entire nation of japan and he even picked a fight with the pope and at the same time he is praising tyrants and dictators like saddam hussein and kim jong un in north korea and bashar alassad for their supposed strong leadership he even praised the chinese government for massacring protesters in tiananmen square trump has repeatedly suggested he would abandon our allies in europe and asia\n\nhe has called nato quote obsolete obsolete nato is the greatest military alliance in the history of the world and it based on something called article v which says an attack on one is an attack on all and article v has only been invoked one time when our allies came to our defense after 9/11 we still have nato allies fighting side by side working side by side with american troops in afghanistan they joined us in going after al qaeda and bin laden now were supposed to tell them we wont have their back\n\nand by the wayright now our nato allies are helping identify and track terrorists who threaten america and europe theyre hosting radar and missile defense installations that protect us against potential threats from iran and elsewhere and as our nato forces in afghanistan stand shouldertoshoulder with american troops they share the risks and burdens now theyre moving into the baltic states to deter russian aggression\n\ntreating our allies like the small businesses and contractors that trump exploited and stiffed in atlantic city  hanging them out to dry  would make our country and our world less safe and it would play right into the hands of russia and china which are envious of our alliances and eager to see them weaken or fail but maybe that the point because what most striking about all of this  and i would argue most important for voters to consider  is the relationship between donald trump and russian president vladimir putin\n\nas former secretary madeleine albright put it and i quote her we have never seen a mind meld of the kind between the russian leadership and a candidate for the presidency of the united states michael morell who ran the cia and grew up just a few miles from here has said that putin is manipulating donald putin is a trained intelligence officer from the old kgb he knows he can use flattery to get into donald head  to make donald the kremlin puppet and it seems to be working\n\ndonald has signaled to putin that he will let russia do whatever it wants from ukraine to syria and beyond he even said putin is a stronger leader than president obama and it gets worse the us intelligence community has now confirmed that the russian government which means putin is directing cyberattacks against targets in the united states to influence the outcome of our election\n\nso ask yourself why would putin be trying to get donald trump elected president could it be because of all of the nice things donald has said about him or the fact that he promised to adopt prokremlin policies or maybe because of his extensive business dealings with russian oligarchs with ties to putin since donald still wont release his tax returns and dont hold your breath we dont know the full extent of his business relationships but what we do know is disturbing\n\nand we know this we are dealing with something unprecedented in the history of our country a foreign adversary trying to influence our presidential election that should scare everyone democrat republican and independent with the election just eight days away this cant wait any longer donald trump should immediately disclose all of his ties and connections to the kremlin and its associates the american people deserve to know the full extent of these links and how they relate to what the russians are doing in our election\n\nwhen you step back and take it all in it no surprise that 50 republican national security experts wrote an open letter saying that they will not vote for donald trump because he would be  in their words  the most reckless president in american history it no surprise that not a single former president secretary of state or defense or national security advisor from either party has endorsed him it no surprise that bob gates who served eight presidents over 50 years democrats and republicans alike has said trump is and i quote beyond repair stubbornly uninformed about the world and how to lead our country and government temperamentally unsuited to lead our men and women in uniform unqualified and unfit to be commanderinchief\n\ni hope you and voters across ohio and america will think about all of these national security issues when you cast your vote in this election think about what it takes to lead  and how we want to secure the safety of our country our children and our grandchildren and who is best to do that so make no mistake that really is what is on the ballot this year it not just my name and donald trump name it our future our security our values it who we are as a country\n\ndonald trump has a dark and divisive vision for america that could tear our country apart but the good news is there another vision for america instead of dark and divisive it hopeful and inclusive and optimistic and unified and it is bighearted not smallminded it about lifting people up not tearing each other down it a vision that says as i believe in my heart that we are stronger together\n\nmillions of people across our country are standing up and saying we believe in an america that is great because it is good that is democrats republicans and independents because we believe in an america where women are respected an america where veterans are honored parents are supported and workers are paid fairly  an america where marriage is a right and discrimination is wrong an america that leads in the world and lives up to our values where everyone counts and everyone has a place where the american dream is big enough for everyone\n\nthis goes way beyond policies and partisanship were talking about what it really means to be an american in the 21st century about the basic lessons we want to teach boys and girls kids and grandkids it turns out if you dig deep enough through all the mud of politics eventually you hit something hard and true a foundation of fundamental values that unite us as americans  basic beliefs about equality and opportunity and freedom and common decency\n\nthat something to defend  and to build on and in the end that what this election is all about here in ohio you can make the difference early voting has already begun so now is the time every phone call you make every door you knock moves us forward you can go to hillaryclintoncom and sign up to volunteer or text join to 47246 to do the same\n\nsometimes  if you have studied history  you know the fate of the greatest nations comes down to single moments in time this is one of those makeorbreak moments for the united states and it truly is in your hands as it should be when your kids and grandkids ask you what you did in 2016 when everything was on the line i hope you will be able to say i voted for a better stronger fairer america a place where our future will be created and charted by people will have confidence that that the best days of america are still ahead of us particularly young people who i believe absolutely should help make that future!\n\nso let come together let us make clear that we are going to stand up for an america that we believe in because that america believes in us and we are going to prove once and for all that love trumps hate thank you
27,thank you  wow! well i dont know about you but i could listen to elizabeth warren go on all day! it is so great to be back here in new hampshire! i have a significant unruly group of women i went to wellesley with back here\n\noh it is so wonderful to be here on this college campus and to see so many young people here as maggie and elizabeth and i were walking up to the stage and a lot of people were hanging out of the windows and were glad that youve got the best view of what were doing here\n\nit also exciting to be here with two weeks left because this is the most consequential election of our lifetime and to see the energy and enthusiasm that this crowd displayed  i saw it yesterday in north carolina i saw it the day before in ohio it really does demonstrate that americans are really looking at what at stake and are coming to the conclusion that we all have to be involved in the remaining days of the campaign and that everyone needs to turn out to vote\n\nin new hampshire you have a lot of reasons to vote  youve got great candidates for congress annie kuster and carol shea porter who deserve your support and youve got a great candidate for governor colin van ostern thank you!\n\ni know that maggie and elizabeth and i have been out here giving the full dose but i hope that you will know what is at stake in the governor race and in sending these two extraordinary women to the house and boy it is exciting to be here with maggie and elizabeth because they are people who fight for you every single day i know these women and it is a privilege to be on this stage with them\n\nnow elizabeth warren has a track record of making it her mission to stand up against wall street and she is going to make sure that wall street never wrecks main street again!\n\nbut you may not know that she was the person behind setting up the agency that protects consumers the consumer financial protection bureau and it was set up to stand against and to do something about the kinds of fraud and abuse weve seen from wells fargo and they are on the front lines of returning billions of dollars to americans who have been cheated and defrauded by big companies by banks and others\n\nin fact i think it is fair to say some of the best tv that you can see is on cspan when elizabeth is going after a bank executive or regulator she is refusing  refusing to let them off the hook and she is not just speaking for herself is she she is speaking for every single american who is frustrated and fed up and i am so looking forward to working with her to rewrite the rules of our economy to make sure we both grow it and make it fairer for every single person working hard here in america\n\ni know we are up here without our phones so we cannot check tweets but  i kind of expect if donald heard what she just said he is tweeting away she gets under his thin skin like nobody else whether she is calling him out of his mysterious tax returns she exposes him for what he is  temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president of the united states and maggie is going to be a great united states senator for new hampshire you do not have to take my word or elizabeth word look at what she has already done under maggie leadership new hampshire has the lowest unemployment rate in the entire country\n\nduring her governorship it was ranked as the best state in the country for business and she has done it the new hampshire way she has brought people together democrats and republicans and independents and i think she has the biggest legislature probably in the world that she has to deal with so she has really honed her skills  listening and trying to work with people and she has taken issues that do keep families up at night from the sky rocketing costs of college and prescription drugs  to helping students to figure out ways to afford to get their education to helping those suffering from addiction or mental health to raising wages for hard working families what i love about maggie is that she is independent she knows how to find common ground and how to stand her ground and that is exactly the kind of leader we need in the united states senate\n\nbecause weve got to break through the gridlock and dysfunction that has unfortunately marred washington we have to get back to listening respectfully we can disagree without being disagreeable and that is why we need leaders like maggie and unlike her opponent she has never been afraid to stand up to donald trump\n\nshe knows he should not be a role model for our kids or anybody else for that matter so i hope in these next 14 days you do everything you can to support her and i want to say a word about colin who i have also known for a number of years now and maggie is leaving some big shoes she does not look like it but she is she is leaving some big shoes to fill as governor colin is the person for that job you know as a member of executive council and i remember this because it took a lot of guts\n\nhe helped lead the fight for funding planned parenthood in new hampshire against his opponent by the way and he has showed that he will stand up for women health 100 percent of the time not just when it is politically convenient he also worked with maggie to cross party lines to help expand medicaid to more than 50000 granted stators\n\nand colin wants to do more to invest clean energy like wind and solar to hold down energy costs to create more good jobs here in new hampshire and to protect the beautiful environment of this state and he will fight to put into action the promise of higher education within reach for more families so please during these next days make sure youre doing everything you can for colin for carol and for annie\n\nnow did anybody see the last debate i stood next to donald trump in three debates for four and a half hours proving once again i have the stamina to be president ive tried to use the time i had in all three to talk about what people talk to me about starting here in new hampshire and going across the country because i take it really seriously\n\ni think that the problems that keep you up tonight that stand in the way of your getting ahead and staying ahead of providing the best opportunity of a good middle class job with a rising income for you and your kids those are the problems that someone running for president should actually listen to pay attention to and come up with solutions for\n\nso you know i do have a lot of plans i do and i get criticized for having so many plans tim kaine and i have actually written a book  oh there one copy right there! it called  oh another copy! it called tronger together and we lay out all of our plans for what we want to do if were so honored as to be president and vice president and you know i do have this oldfashioned idea that if im here asking for your vote to be your president i should tell you what im going to do and maybe as i said yesterday in north carolina maybe it a bit of a women thing because we make lists we do we make lists and we try to write down what were supposed to do and then cross them off as we go through the day and the week and so i want you think about our plans are as our lists  our lists as a country\n\nwe are going to get our economy working for everybody not just those at the top we are going to make college affordable we are going to lower prescription drug costs and were going to do everything we can to keep faith with what we have said were going to do what a novel idea! were actually going to try to deliver results for you\n\nbut i got to tell you during that debate donald said something well he said a lot of things that were troubling but he said something truly horrifying he became the first person running for president  republican or democrat  who refused to say that he would respect the results of this election now that is a direct threat to our democracy im not going to try to call it anything else because that what it is all this talk about the election being rigged trying to stir up people who are supporting him at his rallies that is a direct threat to our democracy and i got to tell you  as your secretary of state i went to 112 countries and i went to countries where people were jailed for being political opponents where they were exiled where they were killed i take this really seriously\n\nand for me the peaceful transfer of power is one of the things that makes our country great  something that  something we cant lose something we shouldnt even doubt we cannot give in to cynicism and i dont think we are ill tell you what exciting to me is across this country at the very moment donald trump is making this unprecedented attack on our fundamental values our institutions millions of people are standing up for democracy registering volunteering voting early\n\nso when you get a little discouraged or you get frustrated by what you see in this campaign think of this we have just reached a historic milestone more than 200 million americans are now registered to vote and most exciting that includes more than 50 million young people the biggest number ever now you only see numbers like this when people are standing up for what they believe in and im proud to see americans coming together  democrats republicans and independents  to reject hate and division and were seeing that in new hampshire too\n\nwe are more than our disagreements we americans there is so much more that unites us than divides us im proud to have the support of more than 150 republican leaders in this state who put country before party but this energy were seeing is not just because of what were against as important as that is it because what were for it about fighting for a future where everyone counts where everyone has a place and no one is left out or left behind\n\nbecause to me and i hope to you as well this is about more than winning an election it about the kind of country we want for our kids and our grandkids that what this has to be about it about the lessons we want to pass on to our sons and our daughters you know we believe we should honor the men and women who fight for our country and that america is safer when we work with our allies to lead the world with strength and intelligence yet my opponent attacked a grieving gold star family whose son died in iraq he has no plan to defeat isis and just last night he tweeted that the new effort underway to push the terrorists out of the key city of mosul is already and i quote a total disaster and that our country is quote looking so dumb imagine imagine this is a guy who says he knows more about isis than the generals i dont think so he basically declaring defeat before the battle has even started he proving to the world what it means to have an unqualified commander in chief it not only wrong it dangerous and it needs to be repudiated on november the 8th here in new hampshire and across america\n\nbut just in case you think that this is new for donald it shouldnt surprise you or anybody else and ill tell you why he has been denigrating america for decades it started before he campaigned against me it started before president obama took office in fact back in 1987 he spent 100000 on an ad in the new york times criticizing president reagan he said and i quote the world is laughing at america does that sound familiar this is someone who roots for failure and takes glee in mocking our country no matter who our president is now that may be who donald trump is but this election is about who we are and i want us  i want us to remember america is great because america is good right and as our wonderful first lady michelle obama said right here in new hampshire when they go we go high\n\nthis election poses a very clear choice on the economy when the middle class thrives america thrives as elizabeth said she is a perfect example of how that works in america so am i so are every one of you here that what i want for every single person especially young person in america with your help were going to not only have elizabeth back in the senate but send maggie send carol send annie and then make the biggest investment in new jobs since world war ii\n\nwhat does that mean that means jobs in infrastructure our roads our bridges our tunnels our ports our mass transit our water systems there is a lot of great work to be done here and guess what those are jobs that cant be exported theyve got to be done right here in new hampshire and across america i want us to invest in advanced manufacturing and there are i know a lot of skeptics about that they say well we cant compete in manufacturing anymore well ill tell you what i dont want us competing with low wage jobs i want us competing for the high wage jobs germany is a major exporter of advanced manufacturing products i want to compete with germany and countries like that precision machining 3d printing\n\ni want us to invest more in technology innovation and research and yes in clean energy because were going to make america the clean energy superpower of the 21st century i think we can deploy a half a billion more solar panels within the first four years and enough clean energy to power every home by the end of 10 years that what i want people to be working on and thinking about and striving to achieve\n\nand i am really excited about what we can do to make sure every young american is prepared i want to start in the early years of life in early education universal prek i want kids to be prepared to succeed because we are in a competition and you know what i want us to step up and compete and win and i want our schools  i want kids to have good teachers and good schools in every zip code and i want to be a good partner with our teachers and our educators here in new hampshire and i want to bring back technical education to high school i think we really  we really shut the door on too many young people who couldve gotten skills that wouldve given them the chance to get ahead\n\nand working with our community colleges we need to make sure that every young person and every person coming back to upgrade or change skills can go to a community college and yes we are going to make fouryear college affordable just this week a new report came out showing that new hampshire students have very high levels of debt and i know maggie has been fighting that and she had a moratorium and she done what she could at the state level but we got to work together at the national level to make this happen for students in new hampshire families in new hampshire\n\nso after our primary was over  and you know what i was really proud  i was really proud of the campaign that bernie sanders and i ran and it was a campaign  it was a campaign about ideas not insults and that what campaigns should be about and after it was over bernie and i got together we put our heads together and we came up with a plan to make public colleges and universities tuition free for any families making less than 125000 a year and if you make more than that it will be debt free in other words pay what you can but let not have kids and families going into debt to get an education this should be an investment that we make on behalf of them and our country future and no matter where you go to a great school like this or anywhere else we will help you pay down your student debt we will make is easier because we a re going to make it as a percentage of you income so you will never be on the hook for more than you can afford and if your interested to see how much you and your family can save you can actually go to hillaryclintoncom/calculator to see how much you can save under this plan that we are proposing\n\nnow i think in addition to growing the economy we need to do a lot more on small business twothirds of new jobs will come from small business so we are going to be just focused on how we are going to be able to start and grow your small business and then we do have to make the economy fairer and that starts with raising the national minimum wage because if you work full time i am talking about full time workers you should not still be in poverty at the end work should provide a ladder of opportunity for people willing to work for it to climb right\n\nwe are going to guarantee equal pay we are going to make affordable child care so nobody pays more than 10 percent of your income for childcare we are going to work for paid family leave because this is the way families are today we are not living in the 1950s families are under new stresses and strains and i meet so many who are really just at the edge they are making all they can make one parent working fulltime two parents working fulltime sometimes parttime on top of fulltime\n\nthe other day tim kaine and i were in pittsburgh there was a long line of people big overflow which we couldnt get into the main room where we were so tim was talking to the families there and there was a woman holding her threeyearold child a daughter i think tim was shaking hands and the woman looked and she said i came here hoping that i could tell you or secretary clinton that i had my baby three years ago and the day after i had my baby i was fired because i called and ask if i could have a few weeks because it had been a difficult pregnancy but my baby was fine but not all that she needed to be i got fired and tim came in and he is such a wonderful man what a fine human being and he said to be there are the reasons everyday why i get so motivated in this election and i just have another reason he told me that story i think your president should care about that i think your president should wake up everyday thinking okay how do i help empower the most people to make the most out of their own lives how to break down the barriers that give you the chance to go as far as your hard work and talent will take you sometimes people say how are you going to get all this done i have proposed plans that do not add a penny to the debt because i see some of my long time friends who back in the 1992 campaign  where my husband ended up we had a balance budget and a surplus and actually we were on the way to paying down the national debt but here is what happened\n\nwhat happened is trickledown economics came back so here is what i am going to do we are going to ask the wealthy to finally pay their fair share we are going to  we are going to close the loopholes we are going to end the fact that millionaires can pay a lower tax rate than a nurse or a teacher or a police officer we are going to make big banks pay for the risks they pose to our economy because elizabeth is absolutely right no  no bank is too big to fail and no one should be above the law and we are going to enforce that and contrast that with donald trump he believes that if you give trillions and that is trillions with a t in tax cuts to the wealthy millionaires and billionaires and corporations and everything will work out\n\nwell it will for him that is trickle down economics on steroids and he would wipe away the tough new rules that president obama imposed on wall street he would eliminate the consumer protection financial bureau that elizabeth did so much to create and you know that was bad enough but then in the debates we learned he hasnt paid any income tax for years so he hasnt paid a penny to support our military our veterans pell grants for kids to get an education health or anything else and his explanation was he lost a billion dollars in a year now ive pondered this ive really pondered this he actually said it made him smart not to pay income taxes but how smart are you to lose a billion dollars in a year\n\nhas anyone here been to a casino he lost a billion dollars running casinos who does that ive never heard of anybody so weve got to make it clear that donald is not on the side of america workers or american families for all of his talk about putting america first he makes his products in at least 12 other countries he stiffs small businesses mom and pop contractors who work for him my dad was a small business owner he worked really hard im just glad he never got a contract from donald trump because it was hard work and people who do that work should be rewarded not taken advantage of\n\nso we know a lot about how donald trump works and today today we heard yet another story it about a maintenance worker at one of his golf courses this maintenance courses told his coworkers he was gay and they started harassing him they used antigay slurs to his face they threw rocks and golf balls at him his supervisor saw it and did nothing and it got so bad he wound up in the hospital finally he went to the police for help he couldnt go back to work because he was too scared for his safety and then he was fired by trump golf club now this is a heartwrenching story on a lot of levels for starters it a painful reminder of the harassment violence and discrimination that too many lgbt americans still face every day and it is deeply disturbing that instead of stepping in to stop the tormentors trump golf club turned on the victim for coming forward if that how donald trump runs his business what does that say about how he would run our country\n\nso my friends there are lots of reasons so many to take this election seriously but here what i want you to know of course i want you to vote for all of us but more than that i want you to vote for yourselves and for your families and for your hope for our future together because if you believe women and girls should be treated with dignity and respect and women should be able to make our own health care decisions and marriage equality should be protected and that we have to take on the epidemic of substance abuse disorders and addiction if you believe in a foreign policy where we work with our allies not insult them and achieve common goals towards peace and prosperity then you have to vote all of these issues are on the ballot this november and i believe with all of my heart that we will after this election get together to help heal the divides that have sprung up and are so painful among us\n\nso please register and vote on the same day go to iwillvotecom to confirm your polling place come help us these last two weeks go to hillaryclintoncom sign up to volunteer take out your phone text join join to 47246 and get everybody you know to come out and vote i think this election is going to turn on who is motivated to vote so we need each and every one of you to do everything you can to make it clear to everybody you know that our future is at stake if you ought to be part of a positive optimistic confident unifying future please come out to vote on november 8th here in new hampshire and prove once and for all that love trumps hate\n\nthank you all!
28,hello miami dade college! it is so great to be here with all of you\nand i want to thank everyone for gathering and in particular i want to thank all of the elected officials thanks to congressman patrick murphy who i hope is the next senator from florida thanks to congresswoman debbie wasserman schultz thank you to mayor phillip levine of miami beach thanks to mayor phillip stoddard of south miami thanks to all the others who were part of the program as we were coming in we heard lots of energy coming from this crowd and i was told as i was coming out there an overflow but they can hear us in the overflow and were so happy youre here as well! so thanks to the overflow crowd but what i am most excited about is to be here with one of the world most foremost leaders on climate change al gore\n\nabout a decade ago al made a movie called an inconvenient truth now maybe some of you have seen it but if you havent i hope youll watch it tonight it doesnt have a lot of special effects  but it does have a lot of drama\n\nand here the main message climate change is real it urgent and america can take the lead in the world in addressing it right we here in america can develop new clean energy solutions we can transform our economy we can rally the world to cut carbon pollution and above all we can fulfill our moral obligation to protect our planet for our children and our grandchildren\n\nnow let me just say  so so let remember let remember what at stake im running against a guy who denies science denies climate change claims it a hoax created by the chinese so this is something that al gore been working on for a really long time and i want you to know how far back he goes it was in 1982 when he held the very first hearing on climate change in the house of representatives with the worldfamous climate scientist jim hansen and then when al became a senator he continued to raise the alarm and look for solutions and as vice president he led america efforts to negotiate the kyoto protocol to cut greenhouse gas emissions you take all this together those 30 years of leadership led al gore to be awarded the nobel peace prize in 2007\n\ni was very proud because he had been determined and persistent and in the face of a lot of people  in public life in business in elsewhere who were trying to diminish the importance of the science  he never wavered and in the years since the climate challenge has only grown more stark and i will tell you this it is one of the most important issues at stake in this election\n\nlook at it this way our next president will either step up our efforts to address climate change to protect our planet to protect our health and to create good jobs that cannot be outsourced by growing our clean energy economy or in the alternative we will be dragged backwards and our whole future will be put at risk\n\nso weve really got to get this right and if you need additional convincing just remember what happened this week hurricane matthew killed at least 26 people in our country more than a thousand as far as we know right now in haiti north carolina is still dealing with serious flooding and will be at least for the rest of the week if not longer we all need to support each other as our communities put the pieces back together and begin the long road back from this disaster\n\nthat why ive encouraged everyone to give what you can afford to the florida disaster fund or to team rubicon the veterans organization working to respond to hurricane matthew or to unicef helping children and families on the ground in haiti\n\nnow some will say weve always had hurricanes theyve always been destructive and that true but hurricane matthew was likely more destructive because of climate change right now the ocean is at or near recordhigh temperatures  and that contributed to the torrential rainfall and the flash flooding that we saw in the carolinas sea levels have already risen about a foot  one foot  in much of the southeast which means that matthew storm surge was higher and the flooding was more severe\n\nplus as you know the impact of climate change goes beyond extreme events like hurricanes it become a daily reality here in miami you have streets in miami beach and in shorecrest that are flooding at high tide the ocean is bubbling up through the sewer system sometimes people call 311 because they assume a water main must have broken when actually it is the sea rising around them\n\nso if you need proof that climate change is real and that it costly there you go so at this rate at this rate my friends my friends please let focus on what really important in this election and in your future and the future of our country because this is what i want you to hear and understand at the rate we are going one in eight homes in florida could be underwater by the end of the century and when kids  like that adorable young boy over there on his dad shoulders  are grandparents we believe that more than 400 billion worth of property in florida at risk and nationwide it as much as 882 billion in property at risk\n\nbut there also health consequences mosquitoes that carry diseases like the zika virus and ticks that carry lyme disease are expanding their ranges and hotter summers and longer pollen seasons are making allergies and asthma worse which is especially bad for our children and look at what is happening in california a brutal fiveyear drought wildfires have burned more than 9 million acres in our country last year\n\nand it also about national security the pentagon has identified climate change as a threat to our america national security the us atlantic fleet is based in norfolk virginia it the largest naval installation in the world and because of rising sea level the base is frequently flooded even when it sunny so that why the pentagon is looking at how climate change will affect readiness and operations not just in norfolk but at all of our military bases around the world\n\nso you would think if you look at the facts if you listen to the science that even the most committed climate skeptic would say ok i agree something happening here we need to take it seriously\n\nbut unfortunately there are still plenty of people  in washington on the campaign trail  who wont face what happening right in front of us\n\ndonald trump is quote not a big believer in climate change as i said he said it a hoax created by the chinese and in our first debate two weeks ago he tried to deny saying that but that tweet is still there for everyone to see\n\nand i would wish that donald would actually listen to people here in florida like miami beach mayor philip levine and others who are doing incredible work to address these unny day floods or maybe he would listen to miami beach commissioner john elizabeth alemon or maybe he would listen to miami beach commissioner john elizabeth alemon john elizabeth is a republican but she supporting our campaignbecause she knows america cant afford a candidate who doesnt accept climate science or maybe donald would listen to our military leaders who say climate change threatens our national security or what about the ranchers in colorado or the mayors in arizona or the community leaders in alaska who say our lives and jobs and families are being affected  please let come together as a country and do something about it\n\nwe cannot risk putting a climate denier in the white house at all that is absolutely unacceptable\n\nwe need a president who believes in science and who has a plan to lead america in facing this threat creating good jobs and yes saving our planet\n\nso here what i want to do\n\nfirst we need to do a lot more on clean energy the clean energy superpower of the 21st century is probably going to be either germany china or usand i want it to be us and i want you to be part of making it us\n\nand we need to accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy and create high paying jobs building and installing more solar panels and wind turbines modernizing our electric grid retrofitting buildings building resilient 21st century infrastructure and we have to make sure no community is left out or left behindnot our cities or our small towns or our remote rural areas\n\nnow you wouldnt know it if you only listened to my opponent talk about how terrible everything is he has such a dark divisive view of america but that doesnt tell the story about what really going on it actually pretty exciting in red states and blue states local leaders are stepping up rural electric coops are investing in community solar power and you see that across america  union workers in michigan union workers in michigan are getting ready to build electric chevys in a plant powered by clean energy iowa iowa is already getting a third of its electricity from wind wind turbines are going up in new england and on lake erie renewable energy is already the fastestgrowing source of new jobs in america i think that is so exciting  there are nearly 2 million people already working in energy efficiency\n\nand in spartanburg south carolina a project called regenesis is taking an old landfill and turning it into a solar farm that landfill was a blight and a health threat just 250 feet away from a residential neighborhood now that same land will generate enough clean renewable electricity to power 500 homes\n\nso this is what we can do and i think washington should back up and support doing more of that as president i want us to have 500 million solar panels installed across america by the end of my first term and let generate enough renewable energy to power every home in america within the decade let make our buildings and factories more energy efficient and cut our oil consumption by onethird\n\nand we can get there by investing in cutting edge research to keep developing cheaper and better clean energy technologies investing in clean energy infrastructure and advanced manufacturing putting big partnerships together between states cities and rural communities\n\nwe can do all of this and create millions of goodpaying jobs as we do so im hoping that these good jobs will offer security and dignity while we produce the clean energy that will power the economy of the future the clean energy solutions are being developed right here in america we want them manufactured in america installed in america and putting people to work in america\n\nand while we do that let make sure our communities are ready for the impacts of climate change that are coming right at us we need to invest in resilient infrastructure now sometimes that will mean building a seawall other times let be more creative  like in new york harbor where we are replanting oyster beds to form natural barriers to storm surge sometimes well overhaul an outdated sewer system to deal with flooding from heavy downpours in philadelphia theyre trying something else green roofs porous pavements curbside gardens to help absorb storm water\n\nand here something we dont talk enough about let make sure our hospitals can stay open and operational in any kind of disaster because sadly i saw what happened in new york during hurricane sandy newborns who had been on respirators had to be evacuated down nine flights of stairs in one new york hospital because the electricity went off nurses i love nurses  heroic courageous nurses were carrying those babies and manually squeezing bags of air to keep them breathing now here in miami you know how important this is you have retrofitted the nicklaus children hospital with a hurricaneresistant shell for exactly this reason and every hospital in the country should follow your lead and build in more resilience\n\nand then finally we have got to lead the world to confront the climate challenge if we dont do it nobody will do it we must confront the climate challenge there no doubt about that and so let move on with the kind of leadership that the world as well as our country deserves\n\nwhen i was secretary of state i worked with president obama to make climate change a top diplomatic priority we fought to get china and india and other major polluters to agree for the first time in history to be part of the solution in fact we had to crash a secret meeting in copenhagen denmark  slip past the guards  it was all very cloak and dagger but for a really important purpose and because of that breakthrough and a lot of patient persistent work and because of american leadership 195 nations signed on to a global agreement last december it called the paris agreement and i am not exaggerating when i say it is our last best chance to solve the global climate crisis\n\nand what does donald trump want to do he wants to cancel the paris agreement he doesnt care what it would do to the planet he doesnt care how much that would damage american leadership in the world he doesnt care what it would do to the future we leave our kids and our grandkids\n\nwell he may not care  but we do and that why this election is so critically important because on the ballot it is not just my name it every issue we care about it our values as a country\n\nclimate change needs to be a voting issue we need to elect people up and down the ballot at every level of government who take it seriously and are willing to roll up their sleeves and get something done please we cannot keep sending climate deniers and defeatists to congress or to state housesand certainly not to the white house\n\nand if you care about climate your senate race is also really important and ill tell you why it is unacceptable it is an unacceptable response for marco rubio when asked about climate change to say im not a scientist well why doesnt he ask a scientist and then maybe then hed understand why it is so important that he representing florida be committed to climate change that why i hope that youll elect patrick murphy to the united states senate\n\nlook we need leaders who can get results it easy to stonewall it not enough to protest we need creativity we need hard work and when it comes to climate change we dont have a minute to waste\n\nso i know it easy to get cynicalespecially about our politics i get that but this election matters more than any has in a really long time and i believe that as strongly as i can weve got to address this issue for our sakes our children our grandchildren and it so critically important when you think about how leadership can make a difference\n\nand just look if you will  look at the difference between your state the sunshine state which has less solar energy than new jersey has right now and do you know why because you have a governor who has ordered the state government never to use the words climate change so my friends this is a big deal in the election and it is going to be a big deal for our country and our world and there isnt anybody  there isnt anybody who knows more has done more has worked harder i know he was in miami just last year training and educating people to be climate change activists i cant wait to have al gore advising me when i am president of the united states so please join me in welcoming our former vice president a climate change leader and an allaround great guy al gore
29,thank you for the opportunity to speak with you\ntoday im going to outline a plan for american economic revival  it is a bold ambitious forwardlooking plan to massively increase jobs wages incomes and opportunities for the people of our country\n\nmy plan will embrace the truth that people flourish under a minimum government burden and it will tap into the incredible unrealized potential of our workers and their dreams\n\nright now 92 million americans are on the sidelines outside the workforce and not part of our economy it a silent nation of jobless americans\n\nlook no further than the city of flint where i just visited the jobs have stripped from this community and its infrastructure has collapsed in 1970 there were more than 80000 people in flint working for gm  today it is less than 8000 now ford has announced it is moving all small car production to mexico\n\nit used to be cars were made in flint and you couldnt drink the water in mexico now the cars are made in mexico and you cant drink the water in flint\n\nwe are going to turn this around\n\nmy economic plan rejects the cynicism that says our labor force will keep declining that our jobs will keep leaving and that our economy can never grow as it did once before\n\nwe reject the pessimism that says our standard of living can no longer rise and that all that left to do is divide up and redistribute our shrinking resources\n\neverything that is broken today can be fixed and every failure can be turned into a great success\n\njobs can stop leaving our country and start pouring in failing schools can become flourishing schools crumbling roads and bridges can become gleaming new infrastructure inner cities can experience a flood of new jobs and investment and rising crime can give way to safe and prosperous communities\n\nall of these things and so much more are possible but to accomplish them we must replace the present policy of globalism  which has moved so many jobs and so much wealth out of our country  and replace it with a new policy of americanism\n\nunder this american system every policy decision we make must pass a simple test does it create more jobs and better wages for americans\n\nif we lower our taxes remove destructive regulations unleash the vast treasure of american energy and negotiate trade deals that put america first then there is no limit to the number of jobs we can create and the amount of prosperity we can unleash\n\namerica will truly be the greatest place in the world to invest hire grow and to create new jobs new technologies and entire new industries\n\ninstead of driving jobs and wealth away america will become the world great magnet for innovation and job creation\n\nmy opponent plan rejects this optimism she offers only more taxing regulating more spending and more wealth redistribution  a future of slow growth declining incomes and dwindling prosperity\n\nthe only people who get rich under hillary clinton scheme are the donors and the special interests\n\nin hillary clinton america we have surrendered our status as the world great economy and we have surrendered our middle class to the whims of foreign countries\n\nnot one single idea she has will create one net american job or create one new dollar of american wealth for our workers the only thing she can ever offer is a welfare check our plan will produce paychecks and theyre going to be great paychecks for millions of people now unemployed\n\nin the course of this campaign i have travelled all across this country and ive met the most amazing people every day ive seen the goodness and character of our country and brave citizens proudly fighting through hard times and difficult circumstances\n\nin many parts of our country the hard times never seem to end ive visited cities and towns in upstate new york where half the jobs have left and moved to other countries\n\npoliticians have abandoned these places all over our country and the people who live there\n\nworse still politicians have heaped scorn and disdain on these wonderful americans my opponent described tens of millions of american citizens as deplorable and irredeemable  how can hillary clinton seek to lead this country when she considers its citizens beyond redemption\n\nthe hardworking people she calls deplorable are the most admirable people i know they are cops and soldiers teachers and firefighters young and old moms and dads blacks whites and latinos  but above everything else they are all american they love their families they love their country and they want a better future\n\nthese are the forgotten men and women of america people who work hard but dont have a voice\n\ni am running to be their voice and to fight to bring prosperity to every part of this country\n\ntoo many of our leaders have forgotten that it their duty to protect the jobs wages and wellbeing of american workers before any other consideration\n\nim not running to be president of the world im running to be president of the united states  and as your president i will fight for every last american job\n\nwe are the nation that tamed the west dug out the panama canal won two world wars and put a man on the moon\n\nit time to start thinking big once again\n\nthat why i believe it is time to establish a national goal of reaching 4 economic growth\n\nin working with my economic team weve put together a plan that puts us on track to achieve that goal over the next ten years our economic team estimates that under our plan the economy will average 35 growth and create a total of 25 million new jobs you can visit our website to see the math\n\nthis growth means that our jobs plan including our childcare reforms will be completely paidfor in combination with proposed budget savings\n\nit will be deficit neutral if we reach 4 growth it will reduce the deficit\n\nit will be accomplished through a complete overhaul of our tax regulatory energy and trade policies\n\nright now under obamaclinton policies the economy grew only 11 percent last quarter  that translates to millions of lost jobs\n\nthis is the weakest socalled recovery since the great depression\n\nover the last 7 years the economy grew only 21 percent the slowest period in seventy years had the economy grown under obama at the same rate as reagan it would have meant 10 million more jobs\n\nperhaps most shockingly 1 in 6 men aged 1834 are either in jail or out of work\n\nmeanwhile another 2 million hispanicamericans have been added to the ranks of those in poverty\n\non top of it all the obamaclinton policies have doubled the national debt it took more than 230 years for the united states to accumulate it first 10 trillion dollars in debt  it took president obama only eight years to add another 10 trillion\n\nnow it would be one thing if that money had been used to completely rebuild our nation our military and our infrastructure\n\ninstead the opposite happened we doubled our debt and in return we have dilapidated infrastructure failing schools a badly depleted military and another 14 million people who have left the workforce\n\nnever has so much money been spent so poorly\n\nbut were going to turn that all around here how\n\nit begins with bold new tax reform\n\nas outlined in detroit our tax plan will greatly simplify the code and reduce the number of brackets from 7 to 3 the 3 new brackets will be 12 25 and 33 but lowincome americans will pay no income tax at all  in fact our plan will remove millions and millions of workers from the income tax rolls entirely\n\nby lowering rates streamlining deductions and simplifying the process we will add millions of new jobs\n\nin addition because we have strongly capped deductions for the wealthy and closed special interest loopholes the tax relief will be concentrated on the working and middle class taxpayer they will receive the biggest benefit  it wont even be close\n\nthis is a working and middle class tax relief proposal\n\nthe tax relief for these workers will be expanded by my childcare proposals that i have worked on with my daughter ivanka\n\nthese proposals are a central element of our comprehensive tax reform and economic growth plan\n\nfamilies will be able to fully deduct the average cost of childcare from their taxes including stayathome parents because this deduction is capped it will disproportionately benefit working and middle class families the less you make the larger a share of your income you can exclude from taxation\n\nparents will also be able to enroll in taxfree dependent care savings accounts for their children or elderly relatives lowincome households will benefit from both an expanded earned income tax credit  in the form a childcare rebate  and a matching 500 contribution for their savings accounts\n\na married couple earning 50000 per year with two children and 8000 in child care expenses will save 35 from their current tax bill\n\na married couple earning 75000 per year with two children and 10000 in child care expenses will receive a 30 reduction in their tax bill\n\nby contrast someone earning 5 million will receive virtually no change in their tax bill at all\n\none of our greatest job creation measures is going to be our 15 business tax rate  down from the current 35 rate a reduction of more than 40 percent an explosion of new business and new jobs will be created it will be amazing to watch\n\nwe will also allow usbased manufacturers to fully expense the cost of new plants and equipment\n\non top of that we will bring back trillions in business wealth parked overseas and tax it at a 10 rate some people say there are 2 trillion dollars overseas i think it 5 trillion by taxing it at 10 instead of 35 all of this money will come back into our country\n\nwe will turn america into a magnet for new jobs  and that means jobs in our poorest communities\n\nnext comes regulations\n\none of the keys to unlocking growth is scalingback years of disastrous regulations unilaterally imposed by our outofcontrol bureaucracy\n\nregulations have grown into a massive jobkilling industry  and the regulation industry is one business i will put an end to\n\nin 2015 alone federal agencies issued over 3300 final rules and regulations up from 2400 the prior year every year overregulation costs our economy 2 trillion dollars a year and reduces household wealth by almost 15000 dollars\n\nive proposed a moratorium on new federal regulations that are not compelled by congress or public safety and i will eliminate all needless and jobkilling regulations now on the books\n\nthis includes eliminating some of our most intrusive regulations like the waters of the us rule it also means scrapping the epa socalled clean power plan which the government itself estimates will cost 72 billion a year this obamaclinton directive will shut down most if not all coalpowered electricity plans in america remember what hillary clinton said she wants to shut down the miners just like she wants to shut down the steel mills\n\nwere going to put our great miners and steel workers back to work\n\nenergy reform is central to our plan as well\n\naccording to the heritage foundation by 2030 president obama energy restrictions will eliminate another half a million manufacturing jobs reduce economic output by 25 trillion dollars and reduce incomes by 7000 dollars per person\n\nhillary clinton wants to go even further and her plan could cost the economy 5 trillion dollars\n\na trump administration will lift restrictions on all sources of american energy production according to the institute for american energy resources this will\n\nincrease gdp by more than 100 billion annually\n\nadd over 500000 new jobs annually\n\nincrease annual wages by more than 30 billion over the next 7 years\n\nincrease federal state and local tax revenues by almost 6 trillion over 4 decades\n\nincrease total economic activity by more than 20 trillion over the next 40 years\n\nin addition we will streamline the permitting process for all energy infrastructure projects including the billions of dollars in projects held up by president obama  creating countless more jobs in the process\n\nfinally comes trade  the foundation for everything\n\namerica annual trade deficit with the world is now nearly 800 a billion a year  an enormous drag on growth\n\nbetween world war ii and the year 2000 the united states averaged a 35 growth rate but after china joined the world trade organization our average growth rate has been reduced to only 2 percent\n\npredatory trade practices product dumping currency manipulation and intellectual property theft have taken millions of jobs and trillions in wealth from our country\n\nit is no great secret that many of the special interests funding my opponent campaign are the same people profiting from these terrible trade deals the same socalled experts advising hillary clinton are the same people who gave us nafta china entry into the world trade organization the jobkilling trade deal with south korea and now the transpacific partnership\n\nthe verdict is in all of the special interests that the media race to for comment have been proven wrong about every single deal theyve promoted  every lie and every prediction has crashed upon the rocks of reality\n\nour manufacturing base has crumbled communities have been hollowed out wages have declined and households are making less today than they were in the year 2000\n\ni have proposed a detailed plan to reform our trade policies and bring vast new jobs and wealth to america this includes the following steps\n\nim going to direct the secretary of commerce to identify every violation of trade agreements a foreign country is currently using to harm our workers i will use every tool under american and international law to end these abuses and i will use our greatest business leaders and finest negotiators  and i know who you are many of you are in the room\n\nwe are going to start with nafta which is causing so much damage to our country we will entirely renegotiate nafta into a deal that will either be good for us or will be terminated until a brand new and productive deal can be signed\n\nwe are also going to keep america out of the transpacific partnership\n\nnext i am going to instruct my treasury secretary to label china a currency manipulator and to apply tariffs to any country that devalues its currency to gain an unfair advantage over the united states\n\ni am going to instruct the us trade representative to bring trade cases against china china unfair subsidy behavior is prohibited by the terms of its entrance to the wto and i intend to enforce those rules\n\nif china does not stop its illegal activities including its theft of american trade secrets and intellectual property i will apply countervailing duties until china ceases and desists\n\njust the single action of enforcing intellectual property rules alone would add millions of new american jobs according to the us international trade commission improved protection of america intellectual property in china would add 2 million jobs a year to the united states every single year\n\nwe are going to stop the outflow of jobs from our country and open a new highway of jobs back into our country\n\nhere is how the plan adds up\n\nwe are proposing a 44 trillion tax cut that will score as 26 trillion under a dynamic growth model which is how taxes should be scored this includes the childcare plan\n\nour economic team has further modeled that the growthinduced savings from trade energy and regulation reform will shave at least another 18 trillion off of the remaining cost\n\nthat leaves around 800 billion dollars this money can all be saved through simple common sense reforms if we save just one penny of each federal dollar spent on nondefense and nonentitlement programs we can save almost 1 trillion over the next decade  again this is spending that does not touch defense and that does not touch entitlements\n\nif our plan exceeds the 35 tenyear growth average then our jobs proposal will actually reduce the deficit savings will be compounded by the fact that people who are currently receiving unemployment or welfare will finally be able to find jobs\n\nthis is the most progrowth projobs profamily plan put forth perhaps in the history of our country\n\nthis is what our new future will look like\n\ni am going to lower you taxes i am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations on business and in your life im going to unleash american energy im going to repeal and replace obamacare im going to appoint justices to the supreme court who will follow the constitution im going rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets im going to save your 2nd amendment im going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country and yes we will build the wall  and im going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals especially nafta  and we will only make great trade deals that put the american worker first\n\nand we are going to put our miners and our steelworkers back to work\n\nwe will rebuild our roads bridges tunnels highways airports schools and hospitals\n\namerican cars will travel the roads american planes will soar in the skies and american ships will patrol the seas\n\namerican steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds\n\namerican hands will rebuild this nation  and american energy harvested from american sources will power this nation american workers will be hired to do the job\n\nwe will put new american metal into the spine of this country\n\njobs will return incomes will rise and new factories will come rushing back to our shores\n\nwe will make america wealthy again\n\nwe will make america strong again\n\nand will make america great again\n\nthank you and god bless!
30,hello orlando! wow thank you all so much i am so happy to be back and i want to thank all of you for being here today at the frontline outreach youth and family center which does so much good work in the community i want to acknowledge your terrific mayor mayor buddy dyer who was here earlier i want to thank pastor wynn tiffany namey the chair of the orange county disability caucus and everyone  especially val demings where val val  i know  got this crowd really whipped up and i want you to stay whipped up for val she is going to be a great member of congress for everything that we care about and are fighting for\ni want to thank anastasia for that introduction didnt she do an amazing job i first met anastasia when she was nine years old she raised her hand at a town hall and she said my twin sister cant speak because of that they put her in a separate class apart from the rest of the kids but she can communicate with a computer and she very smart and would do just as well as anyone else if the principal and teachers would just give her a chance i was just blown away by this nineyearold girl  her confidence and how much she loved her sister\n\nso anastasia and i have stayed in touch over the years when she grew up she became an intern in the senate i was so proud of her speech at the democratic national convention in philadelphia too and im very excited that she here with us today\n\ni also want to thank orlando it great to be back in this wonderful city with all of you youve been through a lot this year and what has been so notable is youve responded with grace youve shown the world what orlando is made of  strength love and kindness this is something we could all use more of right now\n\nim here today to talk about how to make our economy work for everyone but first i need to say something about two very upsetting incidents that took place over the past few days first an unarmed man named terence crutcher was shot and killed by a police officer in tulsa then a man named keith lamont scott was shot and killed by a police officer in charlotte im sending condolences and prayers to their families i know a lot of you are as well\n\nthere is still much we dont know about what happened in both incidents but we do know that we have two more names to add to a list of african americans killed by police officers in these encounters it unbearable and it needs to become intolerable\n\nwe also saw the targeting of police officers in philadelphia last week and last night in charlotte 12 officers were injured in demonstrations following keith lamont scott death every day police officers across our country are serving with extraordinary courage honor and skill we saw that again this weekend in new york and new jersey and minnesota our police handled those terrorist attacks exactly right and they likely saved a lot of lives ive spoken to many police chiefs and other law enforcement leaders who are as deeply concerned as i am and deeply committed as i am to reform why because they know it is essential for the safety of our communities and our officers we are safer when communities respect the police and police respect communities\n\nive also been privileged to spend a lot of time with mothers who have lost children and young people who feel that as far as their country concerned their lives seem disposable weve got to do better and i know we can and if im elected president we will  and we will do it exactly together which is the only way it can be done\n\nlook i know i dont have all the answers i dont know anyone who does but this is certain too many people have lost their lives who shouldnt have\n\nsybrina fulton has become a friend of mine her son trayvon martin was killed not far from where we are today sybrina says this is about saving our children and she absolutely right we need to come together work together  white black latino asian all of us  to turn the tide stop the violence build the trust we need to give all of our kids no matter who they are the chance to grow up safe and healthy in their communities and in our country\n\nnow there are so many issues we need to take on together and that why were here today because in just 48 days  can you believe it 48 days  americans will go to the polls and choose our next president well i hope so i hope so i want to just stress that our campaign is about the fundamental belief that in america every person no matter what you look like who you are who you love you should have the chance to go as far as your hard work and dreams will take you and that is the basic bargain that made our country great and it our job to make sure it there for you and future generations\n\nbuilding an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top is the central challenge of our time and i take it personally because im a proud product of the american middle class my grandfather started working in a lace mill in scranton pennsylvania when he was just a boy and worked there for 50 years thanks to him my dad was able to go to college and then start his own small business printing fabric for draperies and because of my dad and my mom i could head out into the world and follow my dreams\n\nevery american family should be able to write a similar story for themselves and their children and history has shown us  our history has shown us that the strongest growth in our economy is inclusive broadbased growth  when everyone can contribute to our prosperity and share in its rewards\n\nnow here is just one example the flood of women into the american workforce over the past several decades was responsible for more than 35 trillion in economic growth but as women labor participation has slowed in recent years due in part to our failure to provide familyfriendly policies like paid leave and affordable childcare so our economic growth wasnt as strong as it could have been women who want to work deserve to work and whenever they are denied that opportunity it not fair to them  and we all lose out in a competitive 21st century global economy we cannot afford to leave talent on the sidelines when we leave people out or write them off we not only shortchange them and their dreams we shortchange our country and our own futures\n\nthat one reason why i care so much about supporting working parents it one reason why im such a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform because bringing millions of undocumented workers into the formal economy will decrease abuse and exploitation and it will increase our economic breath and our tax base it is estimated if we did this despite what you hear from the other side we would increase our gross domestic product by an estimated 700 billion in 10 years now we need that\n\nit also one reason why weve got to break down barriers of systemic racism including underinvestment that has held communities of color back for generations that part of building an inclusive economy too and it why i believe we need to do more to help young people who are left behind in the wake of the great recession find those strategies and opportunities that will get them moving ahead again and weve got to help older americans whove displaced by automation and outsourcing in our changing economy\n\nand too often training and retraining doesnt work as it should if you dont have a fouryear degree if you havent really had the chance to upgrade your skills over the years it hard to just make a course correction we need to have apprenticeships and community college and technical programs starting in high school and moving all the way up to older workers whether youre trying to start your career or youve spent decades contributing to our economy you deserve better\n\nnow these are some of the elements of my plan for an inclusive economy and im going to hold up the book tim kaine and i have put out because weve actually put in one place all of our plans you see we have this oldfashioned idea if were asking you to support us we should tell you what were going to do right and today i want to focus on one area that hasnt gotten enough attention it concerns a group of americans who are too often invisible overlooked and undervalued who have so much to offer but are given too few chances to prove it now that been true for a long time and we have to change it\n\nim talking about people with disabilities men and women boys and girls who have talents skills ideas and dreams for themselves and their families just like anybody else whether they can participate in our economy and lead rich full lives that are as healthy and productive as possible is a reflection on us as a country and right now in too many ways we are falling short weve got to face that and do better for everyone sake because this really does go to the heart of who we are as americans i intend this to be a vital aspect of my presidency\n\ni want to bring us together as a nation to recognize the humanity and support the potential of all of our people and i want you to hear this because this is not wellknown nearly one in five americans lives with a disability now some of those disabilities are highly visible some much harder to notice if you dont know you know someone with a disability i promise you you do but their disability is just one part of who they are\n\nacross the country people with disabilities are running businesses teaching students caring for our loved ones theyre holding public office making breakthrough scientific discoveries reporting the news and creating art that inspires and challenges us theyre veterans whose service and sacrifice has protected our freedom and kept our country safe theyre working in the white house just last year a young woman named leah katzhernandez became the first west wing receptionist who is deaf so when world leaders come to the white house the person who greets them is leah think of the message that sends about how our nation sees the talent in everyone\n\nand americans with disabilities are working on presidential campaigns i know because several of my staff and advisors have disabilities and theyre doing phenomenal work im grateful to them every single day and people all over america would say the same about their boss their colleague their employee their family member with a disability\n\nnow over the past few days our country has taken leaps forward not just in recognizing the humanity and dignity of people with disabilities but in making longoverdue changes in our schools workplaces and communities so everyone can be part of our shared american life even so not that long ago if you had a disability  if you couldnt see couldnt walk lived with dyslexia or muscular dystrophy or some other health issue  that one fact was allowed to define your entire life because of that and that alone the world was closed to you not all of it and not for everyone but for most people basic essential things that others could do you couldnt and never would and that was that\n\ni saw this for myself as anastasia said years ago when i was just starting out as a young lawyer working with the children defense fund one of my first assignments was to figure out why so many american kids werent in school we looked at census tract numbers and we said okay how many young people between five and 18 live in this census tract then we would look at school enrollment numbers and thered be a gap and we would say wait a minute where are the kids why arent they in school\n\ni went door to door along with people across our country going into different communities i was in new bedford massachusetts we saw a notable disparity there and i soon realized that part of the problem was kids were stuck at home because of disabilities there were kids who were hard of hearing kids with intellectual disabilities i remember one little girl in a wheelchair who was smart curious desperate to go to school but that chair held her back not all schools had ramps or accessible bathrooms most teachers and aides werent trained to help her so she didnt get to go it felt like the world had said to her sorry kid your life just isnt going to be worth very much and she and her family werent rich they werent powerful so what could they do about it\n\nthat little girl reminded me of another little girl my mother she didnt face the same challenges but she too was clocked from a full and happy childhood  abandoned by her own parents raised by grandparents who didnt want her and ended up on her own when she was just 14 supporting herself as a housemaid but then something finally went her way the woman she worked for encouraged her to finish high school and that family showed my mother what a happy family looked like after many lonely years it was the start of a better life\n\nthe core lesson from her childhood was that none of us gets through life alone we all have to look out for each other and lift each other up and i remembered that sitting with that little girl in a wheelchair my colleagues and i at the children defense fund along with others gathered the facts and we built a coalition of activists and families across america and together we helped convince congress to pass a groundbreaking law saying that children with disabilities have the same right to be educated in public school just like any other kids\n\nso we opened the doors to school and then some years later i was so excited when the americans with disabilities act finally passed 26 years ago it was bipartisan the notion that workplaces and public spaces belong to everyone was something democrats and republicans both supported and by the way im proud that some of the democrats and republicans who passed that landmark bill are supporting my campaign because they know where my heart is on this\n\nas secretary of state i appointed the firstever special advisor for international disability rights because i wanted america to stand up for the rights and dignity of people with disabilities all over the world and over the years ive spent a lot of time working for kids with disabilities in addition to anastasia who spoke at the convention another young man ryan moore also spoke there i first met ryan when he was 7 years old i was fighting for health care reform he was born with a rare form of dwarfism but he never let that stop him he had so many surgeries weve lost count of them but his family was always there for them and  for him and he was the advocate for himself as he got older now he a college graduate working in the technology department of his local school district and he just one of the most optimistic people youll ever meet\n\nlistening to ryan and anastasia tell their stories at the convention this july made me think about all the people who never got the chance never got the chance to get the education let alone go to college become forces for change and i thought about all of the mothers and fathers across america who love their children more than anything and want so badly for them to have every opportunity that they deserve to have in america\n\nill never forget something that the actor christopher reeve said some of you may be too young to know who he was he was a huge star he played superman he was unbelievably goodlooking he and his wonderful wife were friends of mine and then he was paralyzed in a horseriding accident he once said that he had been thinking about a phrase that comes up a lot in our politics family values ince my accident he said ive found a definition that seems to make sense i think it means that were all family and we all have value i couldnt agree more\n\nweve come a long way since the fall of 1973 when i was going door to door talking to kids and families but make no mistake we still have a lot more work to do we cant be satisfied not when over 60 percent of adults with disabilities arent in the workforce not when businesses are allowed to pay employees with disabilities a subminimum wage  not when people with physical and intellectual disabilities are still subjected to stigma and discrimination every single day weve got to build an inclusive economy that welcomes people with disabilities values their work treats them with respect\n\nnow one advocate after another has told me the same thing we dont want pity we want paychecks we want the chance to contribute as president im going to give  give them that chance first were going to focus on jobs and incomes im going to fight to give more americans with disabilities the chance to work alongside those without disabilities and do the same jobs for the same pay and benefits people with disabilities shouldnt be isolated they should be given the chance to work with everyone else and were going to eliminate the subminimum wage which is a vestige from an ugly ignorant past good work deserves fair pay no matter who you are\n\nsecond were going to work with our colleges and universities to make them more accessible to students with disabilities to have a truly inclusive economy we need a truly inclusive education system so let raise our standards for too long accessibility has been an afterthought let make it a priority in our curriculums our classrooms and the technology our students use it like what anastasia said about her sister she can communicate through a computer then let make sure kids who can communicate that way have the opportunity to do so\n\nthird were going to partner with businesses and other stakeholders to ensure those living with a disability can get hired and stay hired as part of that well launch a new effort were calling autism works to help people with autism succeed in the workplace\n\nfourth let build on the success of the americans with disabilities act by finally ratifying the united nations convention on the rights of persons with disabilities it has the strong backing of leaders across the political spectrum and it a chance to show american values and american leadership and i have to tell you ever since i was first lady i have had the great privilege of traveling the world on behalf of our country when i was secretary of state i went to 112 countries and one of the things that i have noticed is how far behind many countries are in how they treat people with disabilities very often people with disabilities from the time they are babies and toddlers are locked away basically forgotten i want us since we have been the leader in this area to get that ratified and then to demonstrate to other countries what we have done and are doing to give dignity and opportunity to people with disabilities\n\nnow these ideas are just a start were working with advocates to come up with even more if youve got an idea we want to hear it go to hillaryclintoncom and leave your ideas because we are really welcoming this debate this issue is very close to my heart\n\nive always believed that the ultimate test of our society is more than the size of our economy or the strength of our military it how we treat our fellow human beings especially the most vulnerable among us and on this front especially i intend for my presidency to move our country forward together we will make our economy and our country more welcoming to people with disabilities because we all win when everyone gets to share in the american dream\n\nnow if you want some proof let me tell you this story it a story of a woman named freia david now some of you may have read about freia in the boston globe ive carried a copy of that article around with me because i loved it so much freia has down syndrome when she was 21 she got her first job at the local mcdonald her mother was a little worried as any mother would be she wondered would freia be able to handle being independent could she handle the job would she even pass the sixmonth training program well not everyone in her class passed but freia did and then  then she excelled at that job for 32 years her colleagues loved her and she loved them the restaurant became such a home to her that shed bring her family there on off days just to hang out\n\nearlier this year freia began to show signs of earlyonset dementia she knew that meant she had to stop working but 32 years is a pretty good run isnt it it broke her heart one thing that made it a little better is the whole staff threw a party in her honor her family hoped a few people might show up and in the end nearly 100 people did customers colleagues and friends from over the years the party lasted three hours and at one point one of freia former managers asked for everyone attention she turned to freia and she said we love you we appreciate you we respect you and we are all better people for having you in our lives\n\nmy friends after years of hard work and treating people right isnt that what we all want to hear isnt that america at our best we dont thrive on tearing each other apart or separating ourselves we know we are stronger together we believe in equality and dignity for all and when we fall short we strive to do better not to blame and scapegoat but to improve ourselves to move toward becoming that more perfect union that our founders hoped for this election is a chance for us to move still closer to that goal to make sure everyone can contribute to a growing and prospering america to say loudly and clearly in this country no one worthless no one less than were all of value in the united states of america the greatest country in the world we believe everyone is created equal and you know what else we believe we all believe love trumps hate\n\nthank you all
31,thank you thank you temple! i am so delighted to be here with all of you i saw how much fun president obama had last week and  i wanted to be here in philadelphia\nbefore i begin with my remarks i do want to say how proud i am of our brave first responders working to keep us safe after the attacks of the last weekend in new york new jersey and minnesota there are now reports of a suspect in custody but we must remain vigilant this is a fastmoving situation and a sobering reminder that we need steady leadership in a dangerous world\n\nim here to talk about a number of the issues that are part of this election but really much more than that they are part of our future  the kind of country we want to have the kind of people we want to be and particularly what kind of opportunities we should be providing for the young people of america i have a proud owl on my staff jamira burley a philadelphia native who became an activist working to end the epidemic of gun violence right here in philadelphia she loves temple and we love her and i also want to thank lauren for that introduction\n\njamira and lauren are two examples of why i do have so much faith in our future your generation is the most inclusive progressive and entrepreneurial that weve ever seen and as you heard when lauren was in college she saw challenges facing students of color but there was no naacp chapter to support them and promote diversity and inclusion on campus  so she started one and lauren remains committed and engaged working with an organization called generation progress because she understands that active citizenship is a lifelong job and the call to service never fades\n\nnow i know that with so much negativity out there it is really easy to get cynical  especially about our politics i remember wrestling with that challenge when i was a student during the vietnam war it can be tempting to think that no one will tell you the truth and nothing ever going to change but youre here today because you refuse to accept cynicism you know that the next 50 days will shape the next 50 years and you see how much needs fixing in our country from the soaring cost of college to the scourge of systemic racism to the threat from climate change  but you also know the only way we can meet those challenges is if we meet them together\n\nyoure here today because you believe we can do just that you want something to vote for not just against optimism not resentment answers not anger ideas not insults bridges not walls youre also here because you know this election isnt a reality tv show it shouldnt be about birth certificates or namecalling or stunts to get onto cable news\n\nthis election comes down to a choice between two very different visions for america i believe it wrong to tear each down we should be lifting each other up it wrong to let income inequality get even worse we have to make the economy work for everyone not just those at the top and it wrong to put a loose cannon in charge who could start another war we should work with our allies to keep us safe\n\nit comes down to this are we going to pit americans against each other and deepen the divides in this country or are we going to be as i know we can stronger together\n\ni know what i believe and im going to close my campaign the same way i started my career  fighting for kids and young people and families that has been the cause of my life and it will be the passion of my presidency and i hope youll join me we cant get distracted when the media or my opponent turns this election into a circus my husband has a saying about that he calls it majoring in the minors  getting so wrapped up in stuff that doesnt matter you forget what really important to your future and to the future of this country\n\ntake the challenges facing young americans today first of all if youre willing to work hard you should be able to find a good job that pays well and lets you do what you love and make your mark in the world but that been out of reach for too many young people  trying to find your footing in the wake of the worst economic crisis since the great depression that why tim kaine and i have a plan to work with both parties and make a historic investment in good new jobs we can create millions of jobs and make life a lot better by doing things like connecting every household to broadband by 2020 installing half a billion solar panels building a cleaner more resilient electric grid with enough renewable energy to power every home in the country\n\nnext getting an education should give you a boost not hold you back but as you know better than most tuition keeps going through the roof and debt keeps piling up i understand that temple was founded to democratize diversify and widen the reach of higher education that is still a vital goal\n\nso i worked with bernie sanders on a plan we came up with a plan that makes public college tuitionfree for working families and debtfree for everyone and if you already have debt we will help you refinance it and pay it back as a percentage of your income so youre never on the hook for more than you can afford you can actually see how much you and your family can save under our plan by looking at the college calculator at hillaryclintoncom\n\nand here something we dont talk about enough a fouryear degree should not be the only path to a good job in america people should be able to learn a skill practice a trade and making a good living because of that so were offering new tax credits to encourage companies to offer paid apprenticeships that let you earn while you learn and do more to dignify skills across the board  for welders machinists health technicians coders and so many other fields\n\nanother challenge i hear about all the time is from new parents about how hard it is to balance the demands of work and family in today economy families look different today than they did decades ago i think we can all agree most need two incomes just to get by and many people now change jobs frequently and have wildly unpredictable schedules or they have to cobble together parttime work all without the basic supports available to parents in nearly every other advanced country\n\nthat why tim kaine and i have a plan to help working families with quality affordable childcare preschool and paid family leave we fundamentally believe  the more we can strengthen families the stronger we will be as a nation\n\neverywhere i go young people also share their concerns about the divisiveness and discrimination we see in america today you arent  and you shouldnt be  satisfied with the progress weve made you should keep wanting to right wrongs and fight for justice and dignify for all we see as lauren said too many young black men and women made to feel like their lives are disposable too many immigrants living in fear of deportation too many young lgbt americans bullied too many young women and men sexually assaulted on campus or in the military or at home and more than previous generations you understand that all these challenges are intersecting and we must take them on together\n\nbut you also see a republican nominee for president who incites hatred and violence like weve never seen before in any campaign hate speech being normalized the dog whistles are out in the open and yet despite this i remain convinced america best days are ahead of us in large part that because of the inspiring young people i meet every day\n\nim inspired by astrid i met her in las vegas last summer she was brought to this country from mexico at the age of four with nothing but a doll a cross and the dress she was wearing now she in her twenties and advocating for the rights of undocumented americans and comprehensive immigration reform we should all join her in this\n\nim inspired by mikey who i met in new york mikey spent six months in prison for a lowlevel drug offense after he got out mikey discovered just how hard it is for people whove done their time to find good jobs and opportunities but he persisted and he managed to start his own ice cream shop in new york  and i can recommend it delicious we have to do more to help others get that second chance including by banning the box and reforming our criminal justice system\n\nim inspired by erica one of the bravest young women ive ever met her mother dawn was the principal of sandy hook school who died trying to protect her students erica was devastated but then she made it her mission to advocate for commonsense gun safety reforms it been painful for her  a lot of hate has come her way and the gun lobby is so powerful  but erica wont give up as she said what if everyone who faced tough odds said it hard so im going to walk away that not the type of world i want to live in\n\nthat the spirit that makes this country great  we might get knocked down but we get right back up again and we refuse to quit no matter what and that the spirit we need in this election too\n\nnow i know that with washington paralyzed by big money and partisanship the gap between the change we want and the progress that politics should deliver can look like a chasm i also know that even if youre totally opposed to donald trump you may still have some questions about me i get that and i want to do my best to answer those questions\n\nwhen it comes to public service the ervice part has always easier for me than the public part i will never be the showman my opponent is  and you know what that okay with me and it also true i do spend a lot of time on the details of policy like the precise interest rate on your student loans right down to the decimal but that because it not a detail for you it a big deal and it should be a big deal to your president\n\nso here what i ask any voter who is still undecided give us both a fair hearing hold us accountable for our ideas both of us i cant promise youll agree with me all the time but i can promise you this no one will work harder to make your life better i will never stop no matter how tough it gets in fact you can read about what tim and i want to do were not keeping it a secret weve got a book called tronger together\n\nbut let me tell you a little bit about the values that drive me and my vision for the future because you deserve that from anyone from anyone running for president i want to share with you the stories of three women who at pivotal moments changed my life and set me on a course of social justice activism and public service\n\nthe first woman is my mother her name was dorothy and she was abandoned by her parents as a young girl she ended up out on her own at 14 working as a housemaid when i learned about this many years later i asked how she managed to grow up into a warm loving person and not become bitter and broken and here what she said one word kindness she was saved by the kindness of others like the teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch and brought extra food to share the lesson she passed on to me was simple but powerful no one gets through life alone we have to look out for each other and lift each other up she made sure i learned the words of one of the creeds of our methodist faith do all the good you can for all the people you can in all the ways you can as long as ever you can\n\nthat mission guides me still today when i stumble it helps pick me up because there always more good to do and more people to help if we keep our eyes open especially kids\n\nwhen i met a terrified little girl in nevada who burst into tears because she worried her parents would be deported it hit me right in the gut i knew how hardworking her parents were i knew the sacrifices they were making so that she could have a better life when i met a little boy in flint michigan who got sick from drinking water poisoned with lead it just made me so angry and determined to work even harder every one of our children deserves the chance to share in the promise of america\n\nthe second woman i want to tell you about is marian wright edelman she was a lawyer for the naacp in mississippi first african american woman to pass the mississippi bar she was an ally of dr king and robert kennedy and the founder of the children defense fund an altogether remarkable person one day during my first semester in law school i saw a flyer  we used to have those flyers on a campus bulletin board and marian was coming to give a lecture i made sure to be there and what i heard was captivating marian talked about creating a head start program in mississippi and using her legal education to make life better for poor children and families something just clicked in my brain i began to see how i could translate the commitment to helping others id learned from my mother my church into real social change i went up to her and i said could i work for you this summer she said ure but i cant pay you i said well i am paying my way through law school so i have to get paid she said well if you can figure out how to get paid you can have a job so i figured out how to get a grant to get paid and went to work for her\n\nafter graduation i could have followed my classmates to a highpowered law firm but i went to work for marian at the children defense fund instead she sent me door to door in new bedford massachusetts on behalf of children with disabilities who were denied the chance to go to school back then and i remember meeting a young girl in a wheelchair on the small back porch of her house she told me how badly she wanted an education but it just didnt seem possible my heart went out to her and i wanted to help but it became clear to me that simply caring is not enough that wouldnt force the public school to build more wheelchair ramps or put more resources into special education i learned that to drive real progress you have to change both hearts and laws so we gathered evidence we built a coalition and our work helped convince congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilities and that experience turned me into a lifelong advocate for children and families\n\ni went to south carolina to investigate the plight of 12 and 13yearold boys imprisoned alongside grown men who had committed serious felonies in alabama i helped expose the racism of segregated academies in arkansas i ran a legal aid clinic that provided representation to poor families and prison inmates who could not afford it when bill was elected president a lot of people were surprised and even threatened by the idea of an activist as first lady but i wasnt about to quit then either i fought for universal health care and ended up working with republicans and democrats in congress to create the children health insurance program which covers eight million kids today\n\nthe third woman who changed my life was named sophia the 17yearold captain of a high school basketball team in new york city it was the late 1990s and democrats in new york were urging me to run for the senate and i kept telling them no after all no first lady had ever done anything like that i myself hadnt run for anything since student council id always been an advocate not a politician but then one day i visited that school in new york for an event with young women athletes with billie jean king hanging above our heads was a big banner that said dare to compete before my speech sophia introduced me she was tall and as we shook hands she bent over and whispered in my ear dare to compete mrs clinton dare to compete once again something just clicked for years i had been telling young women to step up participate go for what you believe in could it be i was afraid to do something i had urge so many others to do\n\nwell it was a difficult transition becoming a candidate for the first time back in that new york senate race even all these years later i confess i dont enjoy doing some of the things that come naturally to most politicians like talking about myself but i took that leap then for the same reason im running now to even the odds for those whove got the odds stacked against them especially children and families and ive learned that in a democracy if you want to help the greatest number of people you have to push for reform from both the outside in and the inside out we need activists and advocates entrepreneurs and innovators teachers and mentors people who change lives every day in a million quiet ways we also need strong principled leaders who can win votes write laws allocate resources and do the slow hard business of governing\n\nnow of course politics can be discouraging this election in particularly can be downright depressing sometimes but it matters it really does it matters for our families our communities and our country and the world our most cherished values are at stake every election is important from school board to state senate to president but this time is different we are facing a candidate with a long history of racial discrimination in his businesses who retweets white supremacists who led the birther movement to delegitimize our first black president and he still lying about it today he refuses to apologize to president obama his family and the american people we have to stand up to this hate we cannot let it go on\n\nand when we do that we send a clear message america is better than this america is better than donald trump just as important we have a chance to make real progress together in our country i need you i need you as partners not just for winning this election but for driving real change over the next four years the fights ahead of us are bigger than one election one president or even one generation it going to take all of us working sidebyside to build the kind of future we want that why if im in the white house young people will always have a seat at any table where any decision is being made\n\nso if you believe diversity is america strength not america burden join us if you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage and no one working fulltime should have to raise their children in poverty join us if you believe that climate change is real and that we can save our planet while creating millions of goodpaying clean energy jobs join us if you believe that every man woman and child in america has the right to affordable quality health care join us if you believe we should finally guarantee equal pay for women join us\n\nand here how you can join us go to iwillvotecom and register today register your friends register everyone

represents the best of who we are so talk to your classmates talk to your neighbors help us stand up for our best values and reject prejudice and paranoia\n\nyou know i mentioned my mother and the kindness she experienced her life was so neglected that when she went to work as that housekeeper/babysitter at the age of 14 it was the first time she ever saw a family that loved each other where the parents loved their children cared for them planned for them where she learned the lessons that enabled her to be such an extraordinary mother to me and my brothers everything ive learned in my life convinces me that love trumps hate\n\nso please join us in working together there no doubt in my mind that young people have more at stake in this election than any other age group and when you

potential no matter who they are where theyre from what they look like or who they love that the america we believe in that the america worth fighting for that what weve got to do to stand together we

32,hello pittsburgh! woah! hello back there!\nthank you thank you wow! it\ great to be here at this extraordinary time in our country\ history at this great university to have a chance on a beautiful day to lift our sights to think about what we are capable of doing together the kind of future that we can create if we search for and find common ground and it is thrilling to have traveled across our country to see the hopefulness to talk about the positive changes that are occurring\n\nto really see america at its best and tomorrow each and every one of you gets to make a decision as to whether or not first you will vote because in pennsylvania it\ all about election day other places around the country have been voting for weeks and what you will vote for\n\ni\m here to ask you to vote for yourselves vote for your families vote for your futures vote on the issues that matter to you because they are on the ballot not just my name and my opponent\ name i want to thank tom colicchio for coming out here he\ in the middle of opening another one of his great restaurants but he said he\ got these two small kids and he just had to come and be part of lifting up this election and creating the kind of commitment that will bring a record breaking number of americans to vote we are on the path to seeing more americans coming out to vote than we have ever seen in our history\n\nand i am hoping that you won\t just come out to vote obviously i hope you vote for me but i also hope you will send katie mcginty to the united states senate we\ve got some great elected officials here and i want to recognize congressman mike doyle county executive rich fitzgerald from pittsburgh mayor bill peduto from braddock pa mayor john fetterman\n\nbut mostly i\m here to say thanks thanks for taking time out to think about what\  what the stakes are i love you all too absolutely! so for those who are still making up your minds or thinking \maybe maybe it\ not worth voting at all\ let me just say the choice in this election could not be clearer it really is between division or unity between strong and steady leadership or a loose cannon between an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top and an economy that is set up and run for those at the top\n\nnow i have spent my public career fighting for kids and families and standing up for our country and if you give me the privilege of your vote tomorrow that is what i will do every single day of my presidency i will get up in the white house and i will think about what i can do that day to knock down barriers to create opportunities so that you have the chance to fulfill your own dreams you see i believe america\ best days are still ahead of us now that doesn\t mean we don\t have to work for it because we do that doesn\t mean that we can just expect it to happens as kind of a birthright but i really believe that i would not have worked for 18 months travelled across our country thought as hard as i have about what we need to do and how to do it together proudly stand up and defend the legacy of president obama which has given our country progress in the right direction if i did not believe with all my heart that we could do this\n\nright we can do this! we don\t have to accept a dark and divisive vision for america tomorrow you can vote for a hopeful inclusive bighearted america and our core values are being tested in this election and i know that people are frustrated a lot of people feel left out and left behind there\ fear even anger in our country but i\ve got to say anger is not a plan my friends if we\re going to harness our energy and try to overcome our problems then we\ve got to start talking to each other again and we have to get good ideas wherever they come from\n\nlast night in manchester new hampshire i was with khizr khan whose son was killed while serving in iraq you might remember him from the democratic convention he was not a man to be on the stage of a political convention but when he heard my opponent say what he said about muslims and he looked at the flag that had been draped on his son\ coffin he felt compelled to speak out he spoke powerfully about what america means to him and how we have to defend our values and our constitution\n\nas he said last night his son serving in the united states army with his unit saw something suspicious moved toward it to check it out telling his men to stay behind and when the car exploded he lost his life he was awarded bronze star and the purple heart but as mr khan said when you listen to all the people that my opponent has insulted and denigrated would there be a place in donald trump\ america for captain khan the khan family gives me hope because they truly believe in the values of this great country of ours and they have stood up holding the constitution as he did at the convention to say people around the world cherish this constitution believe in our values it\ a source of hope for billions of people we will never ever let that go and we never let someone rip it away in the kind of negative divisive hateful campaign that we have seen from the other side in this election\n\nsometimes when i hear my opponent speak i don\t recognize the country he\ talking about that doesn\t mean we don\t have problems and challenges it doesn\t mean that we don\t have to do more to help people across our country get better economic opportunities of course we do but boy i believe we can do it i love our country i believe in the american people i know what we are capable of throughout of history generations of americans have risen together to meet the tests of their time they defended democracy built the greatest middle class that the world has ever seen marched for civil rights and voting rights for workers rights and women\ rights lgbt rights and rights for people with disabilities\n\ntomorrow we face the test of our time will we be coming together as a nation or getting further apart will we set goals that all of us can help meet or will we turn on each other and pit one group of americans against another\n\nnow our names will be on the ballot tomorrow but those values and every issue you care about will be there too what kind of country do we want and i particularly think about this for young people as i look at this crowd and see so many students and young americans that deserve the same opportunities that many of us were given we will make sure they are available because if you think about what it takes to have a thriving america it comes down to a couple of key issues\n\nif you believe that america thrives when the middle class thrives then you have to vote we\re going to make the biggest investment in goodpaying jobs since world war ii jobs in infrastructure small business clean energy advanced manufacturing we\re going to actually deliver on that unlike my opponent who makes his products mostly overseas buys cheap chinese steel and aluminum instead of what\ made by american steelworkers right here in pennsylvania we\re going to invest in america and we\re especially going to invest in communities that are left out and left behind we\re going to stand up for the right of workers to organize and bargain we\re going to get incomes rising across america\n\nand if you believe we need a fairer economy as i do then we\re going to raise the national minimum wage because no one who works full time in america should still be in poverty and we\re going to do more to support working families with affordable child care paid leave and finally equal pay for women\ work\n\ni\ve got to tell you this always get\ about the biggest applause ever because fundamentally we know it\ not fair but it\ also about families if you have a mother a wife a sister or a daughter who\ working you don\t want her shortchanged do you now when i talk about equal pay and all of these other family issues my opponent says i\m playing the woman\ card well you know what i say deal me in\n\nif you believe all our kids should have good schools and good teachers no matter what zip code they live in then you have to vote if you believe we can make college affordable for every young american then you have got to vote\n\ni\ve got to say i was very proud of the primary campaign that bernie sanders and i ran it was a campaign on issues and ideas not insults and after it was over he and i got together and we came up with this plan public colleges and universities should be tuitionfree for everyone who makes less than 125000 a year and it should be debt free for everybody else i don\t think you should go into this massive debt to get your education it\ good for you it\ good for your families it\ good for our country and we\re going to make it affordable for everyone and for the millions of americans already struggling with student debt we\re going to ease that burden we\re going to get those interest rates down we\re going to give you a different way of repaying it as a percentage of your income not tied to a six eight 10 percent interest rate and you\re never going to have to pay more than you can afford\n\nyou see i think there are a lot of positive things to get excited about and i think the agenda we\ve put forth in this campaign is one that will really give everybody hope you see working for children and families has been the cause of my life but it\ never been more important than it is right now\n\nso this has to be our mission together  doing all we can to help every american especially every young american and especially every child to have the chance to live up to your godgiven potential because when it\ all said and done that\ what matters the most have you helped somebody else have you reached out and tried to ease somebody\ burden we do it individually\n\nmy mother got through a neglected abandoned childhood because people showed her kindness her own parents didn\t want her her own grandparents didn\t want her but that first grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat brought extra food every single day to make sure my mother had something to eat and when she was 14 and had to go out and find a job to support herself and got a job as a maid and a babysitter in somebody\ home she was just relieved that she had somewhere to live and that she could support herself but the mother of that home understood my mother wanted to go to high school and so she said \dorothy if you get up early and get your chores done you can go to high school you\ll have to come right back because i\ll need you but you can do it\\n\nand look that sounds harsh to our ears telling a 14 year old \okay you can go to high school but you have to come right back and you have to work on both sides of it\ but to my mother it was a blessing so when i think about what so many people have gone through to give us the opportunities that we had had and i\m speaking for myself my mother gave me the resilience the grit the get up and go she told me \everyone gets knocked down what matters is if you get back up\ and we had a lot of americans knocked down because of the great recession didn\t we millions of jobs were lost millions of homes were lost family wealth was wiped out savings account 401k\ everything that people had worked so hard for\n\nwell we\ve dug ourselves out of the hole and now we need to get up and we\ve got to make sure we don\t leave anybody behind i see this man here standing with a sign \coal miners for hillary\ and i\ll tell you sir i know how hard times are and as i have said and you can take it to the bank i will not forget you and i will do everything i can to help people who have given so much worked so hard throughout their lives for generations to build this country we are not going to forget any american! but i can\t do any of this without your help tomorrow\n\nthis election is going to really set the course of our country there\ no doubt in my mind tonight i\ll be in philadelphia with president obama and michelle and i so appreciate how hard they worked for me but it\ not for me it\ for us\n\nwhen president obama came into office put yourself in his shoes  this young dynamic first africanamerican elected to become president of the united states and what does he find he finds the worst financial crisis since the great depression that\ what he finds\n\nwow those were hard hard times i don\t think he gets the credit he deserves for making sure we didn\t go even deeper in the ditch we were in but make no mistake there were reasons we ended up in that ditch it didn\t happen by accident we had huge tax cuts on the wealthy the administration in office took their eyes off the financial markets and we know what happened they ignored the pressures in the mortgage markets and we know what happened\n\nelections have consequences for everything we care about and that\ why we\ve got to each and every one of you put down your stake in our future if the lines are long tomorrow please wait in early voting we have had people waiting in line for two and three hours and there have been reporters and others going up and down the line asking them all types of americans not one type  all types \why are you here\ \because my future depends on it\ they say\n\nso tomorrow is the election but that is just beginning we have to heal this country we have to bring people together listen and respect each other now i know it\ unusual for somebody running for president to say this i started saying this months ago because i was literally meeting who were scared about what they were hearing in this election i\ve known a lot of the republicans who\ve run for president been elected president in recent history i didn\t agree with them on everything obviously we had our differences but i didn\t doubt that they were fit to serve as president this election is different this person is temperamentally unqualified experientially unqualified to be president and so many people know that\n\nso i think we do need more love and kindness right we have to got to rise above all of this hate filled rhetoric all of these insults and scapegoating and finger pointing and insulting i want to be a president for all americans not just some i want to be the president for democrats republicans and independents i want to be the president for those who vote for and those who vote against me i want to represent everybody because i know we have a role to play in building a better future\n\nso it starts tomorrow if you don\t know where to vote go to iwillvotecom you can get all the information you need the polls will be open from 7 am to 8 pm we are on track as i said to have a huge turnout but we can only do that if all of you make up your minds you bring all your friends everybody you know to make sure your voices are heard\n\nthis is a historic historic election and we\re going to do everything we can not only to win but then immediately to get to work and i especially invite anyone who wants to volunteer for the next 24 hours go to hillaryclintoncom text join join to 47246 stop by one of our offices we would love to see you because when your kids and grandkids ask what you in the future what you did in 2016 when everything was on the line you\ll be able to say you voted for a stronger fairer better america where we build bridges not walls and where we finally prove once and for all that yes love trumps hate thank you
33,thank you! thank you all so much!\nwow it is so great to be back here in pittsburgh\n\ni do not think it gets any better than to be accompanied out onto the stage by dan and pat rooney\n\ni am a big admirer of the rooney family and i was so honored to serve with dan when he was our ambassador to ireland\n\nthe rooney family commitment to pittsburgh is really extraordinary and it not just the amazing commitment to the stealers as special as that is but to their roots what they believe in their values and their deep concern for future generations so i am incredibly humbled to be supported by dan and pat and the rooney family it means a great deal to both tim and me\n\ni also want to thank congressman mike doyle who is here with us allegheny and county executive richard fitzgerald who is here mayor bill peduto mayor john federman pennsylvania attorney general bruce beemer and all the other elected officials it means a lot for you to be here with us if all goes well in 17 days we are looking forward to working with you on behalf of pittsburgh\n\nsome of you know that i have a special place in my heart for pennsylvania and i am excited about helping in any way that we can for pittsburgh allegheny county and western pennsylvania to keep moving forward with confidence and optimism about what is possible for the future we want to create together i am thrilled to be here with tim kaine\n\ni asked him to be my running mate because i knew he would be one of the smartest toughest most qualified vice presidents we have ever had and i also knew he had never lost an election\n\ni kind of figured that might rub off on me a little bit now that i have gotten to spend more time with him and with his wonderful wife anne and their family i am even more confident that he will be such an extraordinary leader for our country he is not just smart tough and qualified tim kaine is as good and decent a person as you will ever meet\n\ni am deeply honored to have him by my side in this campaign tim and i are excited by all of the energy and enthusiasm we are seeing across the country and particularly here in pennsylvania\n\nbut both of us unlike our opponent do not believe we can do this alone we believe that we are going to do this by working with all of you and that we are going to come together in the next 17 days and convince everybody you can to get out and vote because whatever issue you care about it going to be on the ballot it may not be listed but it will be on the ballot\n\nwhether you care about new good jobs with a rising incomes or you care about better education or you care about what we can do to get the cost of prescription drugs down what ever it is you care about it is literally going to be on that ballot\n\nnow my name and tim name may be the ones on the ballot but we are going to be representing everything that we can do that you hope for our country and were going to need help doing that after the election and that is why i hope you will do everything you can to elect katie mcginty your next senator\n\nyou know katie is the daughter of a philadelphia police officer i think she is one of 10 children right one of 10 children she has devoted her professional life to protecting working families i have known her now for more than 20 years when she was really young and i have seen that same cando spirit she just gets up every day and asks what can she do to fight for healthier neighborhoods to keep our kids and healthy to fight for cleaner air and cleaner water to help people make the most out of their own lives\n\nnow she is running for the senate because like tim and i she believes our economy should work for everyone not just those at the top\n\nkatie is exactly the kind of partner we need in the senate but more importantly she is exactly the kind of senator that pittsburgh and western pennsylvania needs in the senate we have got to get things done for the people of pennsylvania and america and katie will help us break through the gridlock actually make a difference in people lives help us create more good jobs with rising incomes guarantee equal pay for women defending planned parenthood\n\nand i think it is pretty clear when you look at katie opponent  he still refuses to stand up to donald trump\n\na lot of republicans have they have had the grit to stand up and say he does not represent me\n\nbut pat toomey heard donald attack a grieving gold star family who lost their son in iraq he heard donald called mexican immigrants rapists he heard him say terrible things about women he heard him spread the lie that our first black president wasnt really born in america  how much more does pat toomey need to hear if he doesnt have the courage to stand up to donald trump after all this then can you be sure he will stand up for you when it counts against powerful interests\n\nso you know when i look at this im thinking to myself we have work to do in washington and i know it not easy i understand we have some real challenges i believe we can do it i would not be standing here tim would not be with me  but we need people in washington who put you first who get up every day thinking about middleclass families who worry about where you are going to get the money to send your kids to college how you are going to take care of your mom or dad because they are failing and what are you going to do for them how are you going to deal with all of the challenges that is what i try to do my entire life that is who you should be electing people who care about you your families your children\n\nnow as tim said he asked if any of you watched the debate on wednesday well i will tell you that was the third and last time i will ever have to debate donald trump\n\ni mean think about this i have now spent 4 and a half hours on stage with donald proving once again i have the stamina to be president and commander in chief\n\nand after every one of those debates people have said how did you do that and really you just have to be of good cheer when you find yourself in a situation like that you are in front of 50 60 70 80 million people so no matter what he would say i just kept thinking of all the people i have met throughout this campaign just early today ive met henry over there henry is on top of his dad shoulders and henry gave me a note saying he hoped i would be president and you know i really want to be president for all of the kids in america to do everything i can to help you\n\nyou know i also did have a chance to talk about some of the important concerns people have shared with me from the first day i started this campaign back in april 2015 people have been telling me what is on their minds and it is one of the greatest honors\n\nyou know sometimes it is just fleeting i will be in a coffee shop shaking hands or i will come down and shake hands on a rope line just running into somebody and that person that man or woman or that young person takes a moment to stop looks into my eyes i can tell they are trying to take my measure and i am grateful that they take their vote their choice so seriously and then they might say something like i have a really terrible problem in my family my son or my daughter has gotten addicted to opiates or to heroin what are you going to do about it or maybe they will say my brother has schizophrenia and we cant afford to get him the kind of consistent care he needs  or maybe they will say i am a diabetic and the drug company has just raised the cost of insulin and i cant afford it what are you going to do about it\n\nthat is the right question to ask anybody running for president because at the end of the day this is about you as i said the other night we are going to invest in the middle class we are going to grow this economy from the middle out and the bottom up not the top down\n\nand we are going to make sure that we produce a enough good jobs with rising incomes so that every single person especially every single young person in america can go as far as your hard work and talent will take you\n\nnow ive got to say i believe in hard work that is how i was raised i believe youve got to work for what you get in life but i think we have to knock down some of the barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead and going as far as they should for me that starts by believing in our country\n\nyou know there has been no other place in the history of the world that has given so much opportunity to so many do we have problems we have problems do we have challenges of course we do we are human beings but boy there is no more blessed place and donald trump did something the other night that no other presidential nominee has ever done of either party he refused to say he would respect the results of this election\n\nmake no mistakes about this my friends he is threatening our democracy look i have lost elections you dont feel very good the next day believe me but we know in our country the difference between leadership and dictatorship right\n\nyou know the peaceful transition of power is one of those things that sets us apart and whether you support me or my opponent together we must show we support american democracy and i believe both donald trump and i should be grateful for the opportunities that our country has given us and the best way to demonstrate that we support our democracy is to turn out and vote and there is an inspiring story being written by people across america right now we have just reached a milestone more than 200 million americans are registered to vote in this election\n\nand you know what that includes 50  more than 50 million young people more than ever before i find that a very hopeful sign and here in pennsylvania hundreds of thousands of more voters are registered then were in 2012 what does this tell us i think it tells us no matter how much negativity is out there something exciting is happening right now people are coming together  democrats republicans independents  all to reject hate and division\n\nand in the states where they can people are motivated to vote early to defend core american values and embrace a future where every person counts everyone has a place everyone can contribute you see despite what donald trump may think most americans really believe we can do better most americans really believe women should be respected\n\nmost americans really believe that workers should be paid fairly most americans believe that the united states should work with our allies to lead the world and keep us safe\n\nthe energy we are seeing in the final weeks of this campaign is about more than winning an election it is about standing up to the kind of country that we want for ourselves and our children and it is about the kind of lessons we want to teach our sons and daughters i want you to know if tim and i are fortunate enough to be your president and vice president we will work with everyone\n\nnow i imagine here in allegheny county and if you are from further west you probably know people who are thinking about voting for donald trump and here is what i want you to tell them i want you to tell them that i understand that they need a president who cares about them will listen to them and i want to be their president too\n\nbecause whether you agree or disagree with me whether you vote for me or vote against me i believe we can disagree without being disagreeable i have seen that i know it can happen and i know there are a lot of people here in pennsylvania who have a lot of questions they want to know how do we move forward better they want to know about their town where there used to be a lot of jobs and there are not as many any more they are upset what they see around them i get that but anger is not a plan\n\nand we need  we need to work together we need plans that will help us deal with the legitimate concerns and questions that people have in pennsylvania i think that is what our whole country needs right now that what i will try to do i am not going to pretend that we can snap our fingers and solve our problems that does not happen in the real world but i know we can make progress together the choice we face in this election is stark especially when it comes to the economy\n\ntim and i believe when the middle class thrives america thrives and when we invest in working families in the middle class in small businesses we can make the economy work again for everybody i think it is fair to say that both donald trump and pat toomey have a different perspective they believe  and they believe this  if you give trillions of dollars  and they mean trillion with a t  of tax cuts to millionaires billionaires corporations it will all trickle down to everybody else it has not worked before and it has caused us a lot of messes we have had to clean up and i have been privileged to see presidents up close and personal  right married to one that right worked for one\n\nand here is what i know that when you focus on helping the middle class you end up lifting everybody when you focus on helping the top you help the top that is not good enough donald likes to say he is on the side of american workers but his actions tell a different story yes he has bought cheap chinese steel and aluminum for his construction projects he should be buying good americanmade steel that supports good american jobs\n\ni would like to hear donald explain to american steelworkers filing for unemployment why he put chinese steel workers to work instead of steelworkers here in pennsylvania and for all his talk about putting america first he has made many of his products in 12 different countries so if he wants to make america great again why doesnt he start by making things in america and we now know  we now know he hasnt paid a dime in federal income taxes for years he says that makes him smart well i dont know how smart you have to be to lose a billion dollars in a year in the first place especially  answer me this  how do you lose a billion dollars when you are in the casino business\n\nnever could figure that out but what it means is that every one of us is paying more in federal income taxes than a billionaire has that is wrong and we will end of those kinds of loopholes and gimmicks\n\ni will tell you what it also means donald has contributed zero  zero for our military zero for our vets zero for pell grants to help young people go to college zero for our highways zero for everything and yet he stands up on stage and criticizes america well it unfair and it wrong with your help we will make the biggest investment in new jobs since world war ii jobs in infrastructure our roads our bridges our tunnels our ports our water systems all need help and those are a lot of good jobs waiting to be done jobs that cant be exported out of pennsylvania\n\ni believe we can bring advanced manufacturing back to the united states that is why we will invest 10 billion in a make it in america partnerships that brings together workers and unions and businesses universities and community colleges\n\nsome countries are going to take the lead with precision machineries some countries is going to take the lead with 3d printing we invented both of those technologies we should take the lead and we should have the jobs\n\nwe are also going to fight climate change with clean renewable energy jobs and we are going to help small businesses which will create two thirds of all of the new jobs in america and we are going to defend your right to organize and bargain collectively for higher wages and benefits dont let anybody fool you my friends assault on worker rights and unions is an assault on the middle class\n\nit is time to say loudly and clearly right to work is wrong for workers and wrong for america\n\nso i have set some big goals i am excited about what we are going to do and it all going to put people to work right here and sometimes folks say to me how are you going to get that done you go to the congress well first of all i hope we will elect some or democrats that will be job number one number two i think it will be a very simple question our members of congress members of the senate going to be on the side of the rich the powerful and the wealthy or on your side and you know what they are going to have to answer that question because if they stay beholden to the special interest if they continue to do the bidding of the lobbyist and lawyers and others who stand outside their doors  i have been in the senate i have seen it i know it if they are going to continue to do the work of those who are already privileged in america then i want to make sure that they dont come back to washington after the next election\n\nwe are in a great great high school here and i am so proud to be here\n\nand so we are going to be a good partner with education especially with educators we are going to start with universal prek we want good schools with good teachers in every zip code so every kid gets a worldclass education\n\nand i want us to bring technical education back to high school i think it was a mistake when we took it out\n\nthere are a lot of good jobs that you can be prepared for in today economy  coming out of high school maybe going to community college going into an apprenticeship program and i want to lift up that work a fouryear college degree should not be and is not the only way to have a good job with the rising income and a satisfying life\n\nwe are going to make public colleges and universities tuition free for any families making less than 125000 a year and we are going to help you pay down your college debt\n\nit going to be great to help you pay it back as a percentage of your income at your job so you are never on the hook for more than you can afford i worked on this with senator bernie sanders and it going to help save  it going to help save people thousands of dollars\n\nin fact after a year maybe after you are here  you can go to hillaryclintoncom/calculator to see how much your family can save we want you to know we are going to deliver results for you\n\ni mean ultimately it pretty simple i think the american dream is big enough for everybody and i want everybody to have your chance to get your piece of the american dream\n\nso there a lot of work we are going to be doing we need to raise the national minimum wage people who work fulltime should not be mired in poverty we are as tim said going to guarantee equal pay for women you know look it not just a woman issue if you have a mother which all of us do  if you have a mother a wife a daughter or a sister who working it your issue it good for the entire family it good for our economy\n\nso my friends there is a lot for us to do in the next 17 days because we have got to get the word out we have got to tell everybody what we are doing and why this election is so critically important and that where all of you come in if you do know people who are thinking about voting for our opponent\n\n nope!\n\nsecretary  well you may you know i hope you will stage an intervention\n\nand i do hope you will talk about you know the reality versus the demagoguery of what we have seen in this campaign\n\nyou know we need to come together around all of the issues that are important to everybody and as i said in the beginning whatever issue you care about it going to be on the ballot i care a lot about making sure that women and girls are treated with dignity and respect that they deserve in our country\n\ni care a lot about making sure that we save social security and we ensure that everybody has the benefits that they need in order to be able to live a decent life in retirement\n\nand boy do i care a lot about our constitution\n\nand maybe it because on your behalf i went to 112 countries as your secretary of state and i met a lot of people who in the us because we have been so steady and so committed to our constitutional system and our values and what i hope is that you care as deeply as our founders did as our parents and grandparents did because maybe they came from somewhere else where they werent treated right maybe they saw firsthand what it meant to be deprived of the rule of law\n\nyou know every time donald trump says he wants to jail his opponent meaning me i think to myself you know we dont do that in america we actually have laws and courts and an independent judiciary\n\nor you know when he blows up at a journalist or criticizes the press and goes on and on and on\n\nyou know i get criticized by the press i know that is part of our democratic system we believe in a free press and boy if you go to countries where there isnt one you will understand why that is so important\n\nand when he says there should be a religious test  a religious test for people at our borders a country founded on religious freedom you have to ask yourself who is going to conduct the test are we going to get a quiz what if the border security official does not believe you who gets to decide whether you get to come in or out based on your religion\n\nand if you havent seen it yet i hope you will go and look at the extraordinary statement by mr khan on youtube in a new video that we have put out you remember he pulled out a constitution at our convention and he reveres our constitution and for good reason because he too came from a place where the was no rule of law to speak of\n\nso whatever issue you care about this is an issue that will be decided by this election and that is why im reaching out to republicans democrats independents everyone i know if we bring our talent our energy and our ambition to the work of building our country we are going to see the best days of america ahead of us and when your children and your grandchildren ask what you did in 2016 when everything was on the line i hope you will say you voted for a better america\n\nso here we go just remember  youve got to get out and vote youve got to get everybody you know to get out and vote if you do not know where to vote please go to iwillvotecom you can put your information in and it is the magic of the internet they will tell you where you are supposed to vote you can go to hillaryclintoncom and sign up to volunteer or you can take your phone out right and text join to 47246 and if we can get all of you and everybody you know involved in this next 17 days i will tell you this  it is easy to forget how far our country has come\n\nthere are a lot of people here  as i said whose parents and grandparents came here as immigrants my grandfather hugh rodam came as an immigrant as a young boy and settled in scranton and he went to work in the scranton lace mills he went to work in his teens he worked there until he retired at the age of 65 he believed in our country he believed in the kind of future he could get through his hard work that is what i want everybody in our country to believe again we are going to unleash the talent the innovation the energy that brought people like my grandfather here but which we will harness for the future dont let anybody tell you america best days are behind us dont believe that for a minute\n\nwe are going to pull together we are going to make it clear that confidence and optimism respect for each other bringing folks together who may disagree but can begin to find common ground is what has always worked and it will work again help us help us create that kind of future and help us prove once and for all that love trumps hate\n\nthank you all
34,thank you thank you thank you so much wow\n\nthank you so very very much wow i am so happy to be back here and to be here with all of you i am thrilled and i can\t thank you enough\n\nand it\ a special privilege and pleasure to be introduced by my friend and such a great leader someone who has served not only this state so well but also our country and so i want to thank  once again i want to thank former senator and former secretary ken salazar\n\nand i also want to thank somebody else who\ here who is really special and is doing such a great job for all of you and that is your senator and i hope you will get out and send him back to washington michael bennet\n\ni also want to recognize someone who\ running a great race for congress gail schwartz\n\ni  i was thinking  i was thinking the first time i came to this beautiful place and had a chance to meet people from here was in 1992\n\ni was here for somebody else namely my husband who was running for president\n\nand i know there are a lot of really young people here but was anybody here back in 1992\n\nwell bill and i talk about pueblo all the time and it is always a treat for either one of us to come and today it\ especially important because we are getting closer and closer and closer to the next election and we\re also very conscious of the fact that here in colorado for the first time you are all going to be able to vote by mail\n\nand this monday october 17th ballots will start being mailed to colorado voters\n\nnow if you\ve already registered to vote i hope you\ll keep your eye open for the mail and fill out your ballot send it back as quick as you can don\t wait to fill it out\n\ndon\t do what i do put it on the kitchen counter and then you put something else on top of it and something else and pretty soon you\re wondering where is that ballot i know it cam here a few days ago so please put it in the mail so we can get every early vote counted quickly and avoid a big backlog on election night\n\nand maybe  if you haven\t registered to vote yet please do it right now and if you go to iwillvotecom you can do that on your phones  you do that right now  you can get registered pretty easy huh\n\nbecause we need everybody to vote in this election and we need your friends and your family and everyone you can reach because this is about something so important i don\t know that there\ ever been a more serious or consequential election and we can see that people feel that way because across america people are already voting in high numbers\n\na lot of states have what\ called early vote and the numbers are bigger than anybody thought and bigger than they\ve been in the past\n\njust this morning in ohio people began lining up last night so they could be sure to vote they couldn\t wait to cast their ballots and by the time we\re done we expect record numbers of people to vote in this presidential election\n\nso don\t be left out because we need you and oh by the way if you\ve got friends in utah or arizona make sure they vote too we are competing everywhere and the polls are tightening because i think americans want to turn out as big a number as possible to reject the dark and divisive and hateful campaign that is being run by my opponent\n\nand you know your vote can make all the difference i was in florida yesterday with former vice president gore\n\nand as he said yesterday take it from him every vote counts so don\t sit this one out and i\m very proud of the campaign we\ve run i\m proud of the campaign bernie sanders and i ran\n\nit was about  it was about issues not insults we were setting forth a positive agenda that would help america and help millions and millions of americans get ahead and stay ahead\n\nand to me that is what we\re supposed to be doing we\re supposed to bring people together we\re supposed to unify our country we\re supposed to solve our problems by working together\n\nand i know it\ been a long race but as soon as our primary finished senator sanders and i got together and came up with a plan to make college affordable and pay back student debt provide more healthcare and we have done our best to stay out of all the meanness\n\nyou know the other night  did you see that last debate\n\nwell i was watching my opponent just go lower and lower and lower and i was reminded of what my friend and our first lady michelle obama says\n\nwhen they go low we go high\n\nand i want you to know i want to be  i want to be the president for everyone i am tired of the all the divisions and the barriers i want to bring people together across our party lines across any lines that divide us and not just people who vote for me i want to be the president yes for democrats but also republicans and independents\n\nand i am very grateful for all of the republicans who are supporting me and i am very  i\m very appreciative of all of the newspapers that are endorsing me some of whom have never endorsed a democrat before\n\nso we\re going to keep running this campaign i want to give you something to vote for not just something to vote against\n\nand during these next 28 days we\re going to crisscross our country we\re going to be talking about what we can do together but donald trump is taking a very different tone\n\nhis campaign  his campaign said today that they\re going to use a quote scorched earth strategy for the remaining four weeks of this race now that just shows how desperate they are that\ all they have left pure negativity pessimism\n\nand we\re not going to let donald trump get away with it are we\n\ni don\t care what he says about me i  i  i care about what he says about you and i\ll tell you what i will stand up and defend every single person in this country from the insults and the disrespect that we hear from him\n\nnow the whole world has heard how donald trump treats women and what he thinks of women\n\nand he is doublingdown on his excuse that it\ just quote locker room talk\n\nwell you know what happened it just kind of happened spontaneously a lot of athletes and coaches started posting on twitter and instagram and facebook i mean the national basketball association major league baseball the nfl and more they are coming together and they\re saying that doesn\t happen in our locker rooms\n\nbut of course you know it\ not only women that he has disrespected he\ insulted practically everybody he went after a distinguished federal judge judge curiel who was born in indiana and trump said well he couldn\t be trusted because his parents were mexican\n\nhe has targeted immigrants african americans latinos he\ targeted pows people with disabilities moslems and so many others\n\nand every time he does that i get somebody who is worried or scared writing me a letter or talking to me and especially children it\ really who donald trump is but when you scare children you know like a little boy his mother wrote to me she had adopted him from ethiopia when he was a toddler there were a lot of children in ethiopia that were no longer able to live with families their parents their grandparents were not around and a lot of americans have adopted children in need like that and this little boy named felix is now ten years old he\ only lived in the united states and his mother wrote me and she said that after hearing donald trump he turned to her and asked \mommy will he send me back to ethiopia\\n\nthat\ the kind of fear and anxiety that i hear from immigrant families who are scared to death especially the children that donald trump is going to put together a big deportation force and go door to door school to school business to business home to home\n\nand it is hard to explain to children and so i hope that if you know any children who are listening and watching and hearing some of what is said you will reassure them i want every boy and girl to know the american dream is big enough for you and there is a place in america for you\n\nand that in this election we will demonstrate that america is better than what donald trump says and represents\n\nbut here\ what i also want to know we have a big difference about how best to get the economy going you know trump wants to give trillions and trillions in tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires\n\nyou know that\ called trickle down economics but as with anything when it comes to donald trump he wants to have the biggest tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations than we have ever ever had so i believe differently we\re going to invest in the middle class we\re going to invest in you in your jobs in your future\n\nwell you know you do have to feel a little sorry for them they\ve had a really bad couple of weeks\n\nbut you know part of the difference in how we see the economy i think comes from our experiences you know donald grew up the son of a millionaire he got started in business by borrowing 14 million from his dad so it\ not a surprise he wants to keep giving back to the wealthy because that\ his own experience i grew up differently my father was a factory worker well my grandfather was a factory worker my father was a small businessman i know how hard they worked and i am grateful for the middle class life that they gave us and that\ what i want to make sure everybody gets\n\nthat\ why i believe we\ve got to get the economy working for everybody not just those at the top and we\re going to focus on those issues we\re going to make it possible to have more good jobs in infrastructure we need to fix our roads our bridges our tunnels our ports and our airports\n\nand we need to make sure that the rich pay their fair share because here\ what we\ve learned donald trump hasn\t paid a penny in federal income tax in years\n\nnow this is all allegedly because of course we don\t know for sure because he won\t release his income taxes but it\ allegedly because he lost 1 billion running casinos now i ask you who loses 1 billion running casinos right\n\ndo you know how hard that is but think about it it means he\ contributed zero zero for our military zero for our vets zero for education and health and he has the gall to go around disrespecting our military\n\nhe calls the united states military a disaster\n\nwell the only disaster is somebody who can get away with paying no taxes and have the gall to run for president and criticize all the rest of us who have done our part to support america\n\nnow you\ve all heard his slogan make america great again right well that would have maybe some truth to it if he made anything in america and if he bought things that are made in america there are so many examples but let me just give you one which is close to your hearts because pueblo is one of the largest steel producing cities in america right\n\nso you know how important it is to support our steel workers and our steel industry\n\nnow trump is the guy who went around for a year talking about how he was on the side of workers and all the rest of it no truth to it but you know he did say it over and over again and we\ve slowly but surely uncovered how little he\ done to help anybody except donald trump\n\nand he has bought chinese steel for his buildings not american steel he could be buying american steel he should be buying american steel if he wants to make america great again start by america with american steel\n\ni have a very different idea and in addition to jobs and infrastructure which uses american steel we\re going to do more on advanced manufacturing on technology and innovation on clean energy jobs and we\re going to make the economy fairer at the same time and here\ what i want the young people and their families to hear\n\nsenator sanders and i got together on a plan we are going to make public college tuition free for working families and debt free for everyone else\n\nif you already have debt because you\re trying to get your education we\re going to help you refinance it it is wrong that you could refinance a home and refinance car but you can\t refinance your student debt and we\re going to make it possible for you to pay it back as a percentage of your income\n\nnow based on this plan we will save millions of people thousands of dollars and you can go to hillaryclintoncom/calculator to see how much you and your family can save because we want to liberate young people and families from the burden of college debt\n\nand we\re also gonna make the economy fairer by raising the national minimum wage so people who work fulltime won\t be in poverty\n\nand we\re going to expand social security for those who need it the most  low income seniors and widowed women\n\nand we are going to pass comprehensive immigration reform\n\ni\m going to introduce reform i can\t wait to work with senator bennet i can\t wait to have a chance to make sure that we are working on immigration reform from the very beginning we\re gonna finally help dreamers achieve their dream of following their future and becoming american citizens\n\ni also think it is past time don\t you to guarantee equal pay for women\ work\n\nyou know i started talking about equal pay years and years and years ago because it\ not only a woman\ issue it\ a family issue if you have a wife or a daughter or a mother or a sister it\ your issue right you know that\n\nso donald trump always says you know i\m playing the woman card and my response is pretty simple if being for equal pay and affordable childcare and paid family leave is playing the woman\ card then deal me in\n\nyou see i am very excited i am very excited about what we could do you know i give president obama a lot of credit he inherited the worst financial crisis since the great depression i remember because he called and asked me to come see him shortly after the election\n\nand i didn\t know why he wanted me to be secretary of state but i didn\t know that but i got there and the first thing he says is it\ so much worse than they told us\n\nand it was you remember it was terrible millions of people lost their jobs and homes were lost and it was just a horrible time we have dug ourselves out of that ditch thanks to everybody\ hard work\n\nand we can\t ever go back there because believe me trickledown economics and refusing to regulate wall street and the mortgage market is what got us into that mess in the first place\n\nand donald trump wants to get rid of the new rules on wall street he wants to get rid of the consumer financial protection bureau which returns money to people who\ve been defrauded by big companies well i have a totally different view\n\nwe\re gonna keep those and then we\re going to tell companies that try to move jobs out of our country that if they try to they\re gonna have to pay an exit tax and return every penny every penny of tax benefit they\ve ever gotten\n\nand i\ve been very clear about how we\re gonna pay for what i want to do it is going to be going after the wealthy closing the loopholes on corporations\n\ni can pledge to you i will never raise middle class federal taxes it is not right\n\nand what i\ve been trying to do listening to people around the country is figure out what we can do to help you with what i call kitchen table issues and we thank you very much\n\nwhat  right now  thank you\n\nyou know i always feel so welcome when i come to pueblo i think i\ll come here anytime it gets hard in the white house what do you say\n\nfinally i want to tell you that i want to make it easier for you to raise your kids you know there is nothing more important\n\ni\m now a grandmother of two wonderful grandchildren a little girl a little boy and there are too many hardworking families struggling with the cost of raising children\n\nso right now most families with kids get something called the child tax credit it gives a middleclass family 1000 per child to help you defray the costs i\m going to double  i\m going to double the child tax credit\n\nthat\ another 1000 for young kids to pay for the things you need whether it\ child care housing prescription drugs groceries or anything else it is just one example of the tax relief i want to give to working families and we\re going to make sure that it gets to the people who need it most\n\nwe\re going to lift families out of poverty in fact the changes i am proposing we think will automatically help more people get out of poverty and we\re going to look for other ways to help you\n\nwhat i am interested in is your success your futures your possibilities your dreams i want to be a president who makes it possible for more people to feel like they are really moving and their kids are going to have better lives\n\nthat is how i was raised that\ what i want for you and every single family every single child in america!\n\nso we have about four weeks ago it\ going to be  it\ going to be a race to the finish line my friends and here is what i want to ask you\n\nas i said in the beginning think about everything that is important to you whether it is jobs and rising incomes whether it is education healthcare whatever it might be whether it is protecting our rights\n\npeople who have fought so hard whether it is immigration reform whatever it might be think about it because you know what\n\nthose issues will be on the ballot they may not be listed there but you could not have two more different people running for president than me and donald trump\n\nand i know that if people turn out i know if people show up we\re going to win and we\re going to be able to do everything i\ve talked about\n\nand so it call comes to down whether or not you take that ballot you get in the mail you fill it in you send it back you do everything you can to make sure that your vote will be counted\n\nyou know when i think about this election i do think about my grandchildren a lot yeah you too right\n\ni\ll tell you what for those of you who aren\t grandparents yet it is an incredible experience right\n\nand there is nothing i wouldn\t do for them as i like to say face time was invented for grandparents and you get to check in and see how they\re doing but more than that what kind of lives are they going to have and what kind of country is going to be waiting for them\n\ni know how important it is that families and communities and our country stand behind every child make sure every child has a good education a good school good teachers and every zip code in america make sure every child  every child has the healthcare that he or she needs that\ why i work to create the children\ health insurance program so we can take care of millions of children\n\nthat\ why every family deserves to have a good job with a good income to be able to be good providers for their kids\n\ni got into this work so many years ago i went to work for the children\ defense fund right out of law school and i spent my time trying to figure out how you even the odds for all kids and the reason i did that is because of my own mother\n\ni didn\t know it when i was just a little girl but i learned as i got older that my mother was abandoned and neglected by her parents and pretty much left on her own and then at the age of eight holding her little threeyearold sister\ hand she was put on a train by themselves to go to california to live with grandparents\n\nit turned out the grandparents didn\t really want her either so by the age of 14 she was working in a house as a maid and a babysitter but here\ what i want you to know it sounds pretty harsh it was difficult it made a profound impression on her life i think my mom who lived to the wonderful age of 92 i don\t think there was a day that went by that she didn\t think about being abandoned and being sent away and being pretty much left on her own\n\nbut along the way people were kind to her people helped her the first grade teacher who brought lunch for her every day because my mother never had any  the woman whose house she went to work in all those years ago knew my mother wanted to go to high school so she said to her dorothy if you get up early and you get your chores done you can go to high school\n\nnow you\ll have to come right back home that might sound kind of unfortunate but for my mom it was a gift because she really wanted to go to high school\n\nand so my mother always cared about other people and she taught me in every way she could that nobody is better than anybody else right\n\nand we need to show each other more kindness and support and the last thing we need in our country are more bullies making people feel bad about themselves and pushing people away we should be drawing people toward us\n\nwe should be creating the kind of future we want for every one of our children that\ what i think about when i imagine if i\m so fortunate enough to become president i think about waking up  waking up \n\ni think about waking up in the white house every morning trying to figure out what can i do to help somebody else and who can i work with how many families and communities across america will work with us to come up with ideas that give every single child the chance to live up to his or her god given potential\n\nthat\ what i think we are called to do whether you\re a person of faith or not the american dream is really premised on people coming together to lift each other up nobody nobody makes it alone everybody has somebody who helps them along the way\n\nso let\ pull together pueblo let\ get out and vote for the kind of positive future we want for ourselves and our children god bless you thank you
35,thank you wow! thank you all woo!\nthank you thank you i  i got to  i got to say after hearing  after hearing from these two extraordinary men i  i feel all fired up and ready to go for the next five days\n\nit is so great to be back here with all of you and there are a few people in the audience that i just want to acknowledge because i\m delighted they\re there  us congressman david price i saw right therethank you david\n\nstate senator dan blue jr i know right there thank you danand i\m not sure she\ still here but deborah ross who i hope is your next senator there she is!\n\nbecause everything pharrell and bernie just said is not only about the presidential election and what\ at stake it is about who\ going to represent you as your governor as your senator as members of congress and the legislature and you have some excellent candidates and we are so hopeful that you will vote for them and vote for what they represent\n\nnow i really want to thank my friend bernie sanders for everything that he has done\n\ni  i got to serve with bernie we were colleagues in the senate i saw firsthand his commitment to the people of vermont and to the values that have guided his life and when we faced each other in the primary here\ what i was so proud about we ran a campaign on the issues that matter to the american people\n\nand i  i think because of that campaign we were able to raise a lot of the issues that you heard bernie talking about to the level that they are part of this presidential campaign and they will be part of our agenda after january 20th bernie\n\nand i\ve got to say too this election has been a lot more fun now that we\re on the same side\n\nand i want to thank bernie for everything he\ done he\ crisscrossing our country energizing people getting folks off the sidelines and engaged in politics and there\ no question that his efforts are paying off\n\nand what he said at the beginning of his remarks is absolutely true my name may be on the ballot but it is not about me it\ not about my opponent it\ not about bernie it\ not about david or deborah it is about you and your lives and what we\re going to do together\n\nnow bernie and i have already worked we\ve worked on the plan that he told you about to make college tuitionfree for the middleclass for working families for poor kids and debtfree for everyone\n\nbecause as bernie said earlier this year when people who care about progressive causes stand together we win and then we can get to work on making those causes into realities for the lives of our people so i am proud to be here with you and i am so excited about  of the election about everything that we\re going to do together\n\nand i\m especially pleased to have pharrell here\n\nnow every time i see him which is not often enough we always have a good conversation like we did before this event he always gets you to think not only is he a worldclass talent but he is a passionate advocate for issues that are too often overlooked and ignored he wants to  and i\m going to do everything i can help him  to deliver  giving kids who are at risk access to educational and arts programs that they deserve to have just as much as any other child\n\nso tell me this tell me this north carolina tell me north carolina are you really really really happy that we\re here tonight\n\nwell we sure are there\ nowhere we\d rather benow let me ask you this how many of you have already votedwell i hope you\re going to bring more people to vote as well rightare you ready to volunteer\n\nwe can all use you in these last days are you ready to elect roy cooper\n\nwell i\m glad to hear that because it\ time you had a governor who puts families first not radical ideologyand i love seeing our educators stand up and applaud because you need a governor who actually cares about the education of the children of north carolina\n\nnow are you ready to elect deborah ross to the united states senate i\ll tell you  i\ll tell you deborah and her race are the talk of everywhere people know she will be an independent voice for north carolina families that she will represent you with integrity and excellence and unlike her opponent she\ never been afraid to stand up to donald trump\n\nare you ready now to choose our next president and commanderin chief\n\nwell i\m  i\m excited did any of you see the debateswell you know there\ several  there\ several notable aspects of those debates\n\ni mean one is the very fact that i stood on the stage for four and a half hours with my opponent proving once and for all i have the stamina to be president and commanderinchief\n\nbut you know  but you know he  he also kept saying like oh well you know what have you done for the last 30 years and you know occasionally i would interject and say what i had done\n\nand today in greenville we had a perfect comparison i started my career fighting for children and families with the children\ defense fund when i got right out of law school in the 1970\\n\ni went to south carolina to gather evidence to stop the government in south carolina for  from putting young men teenagers in jails with adults i went to alabama undercover to gather information about segregated academies to deprive them of taxexempt status which they did not deserve\n\ni went doortodoor in new bedford massachusetts gathering information to make the case that every child in america including children with disabilities should have the right to a public school education\n\nand as we heard this morning from a  just a wonderful distinguished older woman by the name of mae wiggins who came all the way down to tell her story she was a nurse in new york city back in the 1970\ excited about being a young nurse getting her career off to a start and she was looking for a place to live and she had a budget like everybody does and she found what she thought would be the perfect place it was within her budget it was close to work\n\nshe went to apply for an apartment it was a new building  brand new building it wasn\t even totally finished yet she went into the little office and asked for an application and they said oh we don\t have any apartments she said but i saw the advertisement well we have no apartments left\n\nwell she thought that was pretty peculiar and so she decided to do a little investigation and she found out that all of her african american friends who had gone to that apartment run by donald trump and his father fred had been told there were no apartments\n\nso she had the gumption to go and make a complaint which led to the justice department suing them for discrimination they settled the suit but then they had to come back a year later and sue them again because they were still discriminating\n\nso when you hear as bernie so powerfully said at the end of his remarks that we are standing against the possibility of returning and normalizing discrimination take it seriously my friends because it truly is  it truly is at stake in this election\n\nand i was also very very grateful i had a role in helping to create the children\ health insurance program as first lady and let me tell you one of the great  one of the great honors as i travel across the country is meeting young people who are the beneficiaries or meeting their families\n\ni met a woman here in north carolina who told her story and we actually recorded it because all of us were so moved by what she had to say when her baby was born her daughter she was deaf and the doctors all said she\ll never  she\ll never communicate so she cannot learn to speak so you need to teach her sign language\n\nand the mom did all this research and concluded that there were some treatments that might help her daughter but she didn\t have that kind of money they didn\t have that kind of insurance and she was telling her doctor she didn\t know what to do and the doctor just serendipitously said you know there\ this new program it\ called the children\ health insurance program it\ for people who are not poor but they don\t make enough money to afford that kind of insurance and they don\t work for an employer who provides it you should look into it and she did and that began the process of her getting the treatment that her daughter needed\n\nand when i met the mother i also met the daughter right here i talked with her she told me how proud she was because she had just graduated from college george washington university\n\nso yes you know i do sweat the details and i do have a lot of plans tim kaine and i put a whole book out called stronger together telling you exactly what we\re going to try to do if we\re fortunate enough to be president and vice president because i actually think it\ important for you to know what we\re going to do together\n\nand as your  as a senator i helped to rebuild new york city after 9/11 and provided health care to our brave first responders as your secretary of state i traveled to 112 countries negotiated ceasefires reduced the threat of nuclear weapons stood up for human rights and women\ rights and lgbt rights all around the world\n\nand you know everything i\ve done started by listening to people listening to hear your stories what you\re worried about and then working to bring people together to find common ground even with people who disagreed with me on lots of issues\n\nyou know when i was first lady i had a great commitment to kids in foster care and i wanted to improve our foster care and adoption laws and i was looking for some republican to work with me and i found one because i did my research and found out that one of the most partisan republicans congressman tom delay from texas had a heart for children in foster care he and his wife had fostered children and i called him up\n\ni said congressman would you work with me to change the laws on foster care and adoption there was a silence he said well what do you want me to do i said well come to the white house come to a meeting we\ll sit down and figure out what we can do and we did and i meet those kids and i meet those families kids who were taken out of foster care and given the chance to have a loving permanent family for the first time\n\nnow i\m telling you this because i really believe that\ the only way we\re going to get things done and if you elect me next tuesday that is the kind of president i will be\n\nso let me just mention a few of the ideas that we\ve been putting forward to help you and your families get ahead and stay ahead because i truly believe you need a candidate you can vote for not just someone to vote against\n\nbut as you\re making this choice we need to be clear about what the choice is because come january 20th america will have a new president it will either be me or my opponent\n\nnow i think it\ fair to say things are going to change change is part of life that much is certain the question is what kind of change are we going to see are we going to build a stronger fairer better america or are we going to fear each other and fear our future\n\ni want you just to imagine imagine the different kinds of futures that are available depending upon who\ elected on january 20th because by imagining it i want you to think about every issue you care about everything that is dear to you everything that you heard from pharrell and from bernie\n\nit\ hard for me to imagine that we would have a president who has demeaned women mocked the disabled insulted africanamericans and latinos pitted people against each other instead of bringing them together that is unfortunately though what we have seen in this campaign what we have seen what\ been said and how distressful it\ been\n\ni know there are a lot of people who are upset about what\ going on in this campaign aren\t there people come and talk to me i\ve had people say that they can\t sleep that their stomachs are bothering them they have headaches and i think that\ an important signal because this is a big decision and as michelle obama has said the presidency doesn\t change you  who you are it reveals who you are\n\nand i think it\ fair to say that my opponent has already revealed who he is and he wants to ban every muslim in the world from coming to the united states our country is founded on religious freedom it is one of the most important building blocks of our democracy\n\nhe has said that he thinks the lives of black people are all crime and poverty and despair he has no idea  no idea about the strength of the black church the vibrancy of blackowned businesses the excellence of historically black colleges and universities\n\nhe seems not to recognize the rise of a new generation of black activists for social justice and the success of black leaders in every field\n\nand we saw that again in the way he treated the central park five these were five black and latino kids some as young as 14 who were wrongly convicted of a terrible crime in new york city back in 1990 donald trump took out fullpage ads in four newspapers calling for the death penalty for these kids nearly three decades later they were exonerated by dna evidence\n\nand in addition someone else confessed to the crime so they were finally released from prison but not only did trump refuse to apologize for what he had said about them and even calling for their executions he actually said they should still be in prison evidence didn\t matter the law didn\t matter to him those kids would always be guilty\n\nso think about it if he wants to keep exonerated people in jail how can we trust him to fight for the rule of justice and fairness and criminal justice reform in america\n\ndo we want him appointing our judges\n\n no!\n\n do we want him controlling the justice department\n\n no!\n\n well i\ve said many times he has shown us who he is now it is up to us to decide who we are and right now people across our country are coming together to do just that they are rejecting the dark and divisive vision for one that is more hopeful and inclusive we know that america is bighearted not smallminded we want to lift people up not tear each other down\n\nand that\ why i do believe we are stronger together so let me paint you a different picture here\ what we\re going to do together we\re going to take on systemic racism with a full commitment and real followthrough because we refuse to accept as normal some of what we\re seeing across america\n\nwhat happened to that church in mississippi yesterday should not have happened and it should never be accepted people painted the words vote trump on the side and then set it on fire who would do that who would do that to a place of worship where people seek solace that can never be normal it can never be acceptable\n\nwhat happened in flint michigan as bernie said can never be normal can never be acceptable\n\nlittle children drinking and bathing in poisoned water that will affect their health for years to come\n\nand then we know don\t we too many young africanamericans are dying in police incidents or because of gun violence\n\nwe know their names trayvon martin and eric garner and sandra bland and keith scott and so many others we have got to face this and we\re going to get to work to do just that we are going to  we are going to dismantle the socalled schooltoprison pipeline and we\re going to replace it with a cradletocollege pipeline\n\nand we\re going to start with our youngest kids and their families to give them the support that they need and we\re going to take a hard look at what we need to do to make sure every child has the chance to attend good schools with good teachers no matter what their zip code is\n\nand we will reform our criminal justice system from endtoend it is wrong my friends that black men are far more likely to be stopped by police charged and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men for the same offenses\n\nwhen i  when i launched this campaign back in april of 2015 the very first speech i gave was on the topic of criminal justice reform i said then and i have repeated it throughout this campaign we must end the era of mass incarceration\n\ntoo many families have been broken up too many communities have been so badly affected we have to reform these mandatory minimums and sentencing we have to ban the box so people who have served their time can get a real chance at a good job and a fresh start\n\nand we have to restore trust between police and communities we are all safer when everyone has respect for the law and everyone is respected by the law\n\nthis is important of course to families and communities but it is important to all of us this is about who we are as a country about whether we really are a nation that believes in freedom and justice for all too often despite the progress we\ve made we fall short of that goal and we have to be honest about it\n\ni am determined to make this one of the most important projects of my presidency and i hope all of you will join me in doing that\n\nand i have to say  i have to say that is only part of what must be done because the leading cause of death for young africanamerican men more than the next nine causes\n\nwe have 33000 people a year dying from guns i just cannot tolerate this any longer i have met the families of those who have lost loved ones who have lost the first graders in sandy hook the bible study churchgoers in charleston the clubgoers in orlando the moviegoers in aurora colorado people going about their lives being cut down and cut senselessly short we have to take steps to reduce gun violence and i know we can do that because the vast majority of americans agree something must be done and a very big majority of gun owners agree as well\n\nand we\ve got to make investments in those communities that are struggling especially communities of color\n\nwhen i was in eastern north carolina today and i was talking to people there who had been devastated by hurricane matthew people who didn\t have very much to start with who lost everything farmers with 100 200 acres growing sweet potatoes wiped out we\ve got to help everybody get ahead\n\ni believe that the economy must work for everyone not just those at the top and i think hardworking americans deserve a raise and women deserve equal pay\n\nso how are we going to do this well we\re going to go where the money is just as bernie said we\re going to make the wealthy pay their fair share and make sure wall street never threatens main street again\n\nand i can\t wait to work with bernie to make public colleges and universities like nc state right here at raleigh tuitionfree\n\ni know that this is another issue pharrell feels passionately about as well if you\re struggling with student debt we\re going to cut that and help you pay it back and get out from under it\n\nand in my plan is a 25 billion fund specifically aimed at supporting historically black colleges and universities  schools like shaw and saint augustine  because you know they produce some of the finest leaders in our country and i want to make sure they keep doing that vital work\n\nso we could go on all night i mean bernie and i could really keep you here until breakfast because we get excited about what we can do but of course we can\t do anything if you don\t get out and vote and get everybody you know to vote\n\nthis is going to be one of the most consequential elections in our country\ history you know that because we are at a crossroads it\ not just who my opponent is pharrell is right we don\t even have to mention his name very much right it\ not just about him although there are some special features that certainly raise deep concerns it\ about who we are it\ about what we want what we\re going to do to make our mark on our country at this time in our history\n\ni believe  i believe america\ best days are still ahead of us if we do what we\re supposed to do\n\nevery social movement every economic advance has only come about because people were willing to work and sacrifice and keep pushing forward in the face of adversity it\ not easy it wasn\t easy to get the vote for women it wasn\t easy to have the final efforts made to ensure that the civil rights act was enforced it wasn\t easy because there are powerful interests still trying to push us back and push us down\n\nand right now you know because in this state a lot of effort was put into trying to suppress the vote right\n\nand some people got discouraged about that i\ve met some people who say well you know i don\t even know what they want what kind of identification it gets a little discouraging you cannot get discouraged do not grow weary while doing good right\n\nit is now our turn  our turn to stand up to people like your governor and your legislature who wanted to shut you down and push you back because we are fundamentally a good nation and we need to make sure we deliver on that promise\n\nand in this election president obama\ entire legacy is on the line everything that he has worked so hard to do against implacable opposition as the president said yesterday everything we\ve done is dependent upon him being able to pass the baton to somebody who believes in the same things he believes in\n\nso i got to tell you i\ve told the president i\m ready to take the baton but he\ going to have to bend over because he\ a lot taller than i am\n\nbut i\m not just taking it all of us are taking it we are ready to grab that baton to defend and build upon the progress of his presidency and that is why everyone must vote early vote and vote on tuesday if you can\t get to early voteand listen to this more than two million right here in north carolina have already voted\n\nso make no mistake about it you can make the difference not only in who you elect but in the agenda that those people will then get to work on i want you to hold me accountable i want you to be my partners but i can\t do any of this\n\nyou know when i was with our wonderful first lady last week she reminded she reminded the big crowd we had in winstonsalem that president obama in 2008 won this state by about 14000 votes\n\nif you break that down you know what the difference between winning and losing is roughly two votes per precinct so don\t let anybody tell you their vote doesn\t matter you\ve got to get everyone you know to come out and vote you can vote early through this saturday november 5th if you don\t know where to vote go to iwillvotecom to confirm your voting location because the best way to repudiate the bigotry and the bluster and the bullying and the hateful rhetoric and discrimination is to show up with the biggest turnout in american history\n\nand then that will be the story of this election let\ make that one for the history books please be part of what we\re doing in these next days and let\ make sure that we not only have a future we can believe in but one we can help create together and demonstrate once and for all that love trumps hate\n\nthank you all
36,thank you all! whoa! thank you! thank you well i got to tell you this is sure worth staying up for it is so great to be here in raleigh here at north carolina state university and i cannot imagine a better way of ending this campaign than having the opportunity to see all of you and to watch and listen to lady gaga one of the most inventive creative and passionate performers whose range goes from a to z and beyond and i was watching on the screen not only her perform but all of you jumping and singing and waving it was great!\nbecause you know what that what i want for america and the young people of america the joy the passion the intensity! and our longtime friend jon bon jovi was with us he was with us up in philadelphia where he and bruce springsteen sang and jon said well hey i want to go down to raleigh and so here he is! and between now and the time the poll closes tomorrow we are going to be living on a prayer\n\ni was really impressed when everybody hand went up saying youd already voted well go find somebody else who hasnt voted okay bring out your friends your roommates strangers on the street just stop and talk to them about what at stake in this election because north carolina is key and it not only important for our election are you ready to elect roy cooper as your next governor well i sure hope so i sure hope so and i hope youre ready to elect linda coleman your lieutenant governor and how about dan blue iii for state treasurer and i really really hope you will send deborah ross to washington!\n\nnow we are all fired up when we were with the president and michelle in philadelphia you know the president was talking about how absolutely consequential this election is and of course it is i really believe it the most important election of our lifetimes because weve never had a clearer choice never it is a choice between division or unity between strong steady leadership or a loose cannon who could risk everything it a choice between an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top and it is a choice that really goes to the heart of who we are as americans\n\nwhat i saw before i came in and what i see now is a sense of potential of joy there is no reason my friends why america best days are not ahead of us if we reach for them together we dont have to accept a dark and divisive vision for america tomorrow you can vote for a hopeful inclusive bighearted america\n\nour core values  our core values are being tested in this election but my faith in our future has never been stronger i love our country and i believe in the american people and i know if we bring everyone together we can set goals and we can move toward them and we can feel that sense of accomplishment that comes with being part of something bigger than ourselves\n\nyou know one of the great privileges of crisscrossing the country as i have in this campaign is meeting remarkable people  people who stand up against the odds people who like my late mother people who understand that everybody gets knocked down what matters is whether you get back up whether you believe you can keep going\n\nlast night in manchester new hampshire i had the honor of being introduced by an extraordinary man khizr khan whose son captain khan was killed serving our country in iraq you may remember mr khan speech at the democratic convention and again last night he reminded us of the responsibility we all share to protect and defend our constitution the story of captain khan is one of courage in the face of danger he was with his unit when he saw a suspicious vehicle he told his men to stay back he moved toward the vehicle to check it out and the bomb went off he lost his life but everyone else in his unit survived he was awarded the bronze star and this intensely personal tragedy that the khan family experienced becoming a gold star family was one that they thought about grieved over in the privacy of their home until they heard my opponent start talking about who was acceptable in america and who wasnt the categories of people starting with immigrants including african americans and latinos and pows and muslims the list went on and on and it created in mr khan a sense of despair because he asked himself would his son have a place in donald trump america someone who paid the ultimate price in serving our country\n\nwell we can answer that question tomorrow resoundingly yes absolutely\n\nthink about  think about how generations of americans throughout our history have come together to meet the tests of their time our parents our grandparents our greatgrandparents defended democracy they built the great american middle class they marched for civil rights and voting rights for workers rights and women rights for lgbt rights and the rights of people with disabilities and tomorrow we face the test of our time\n\nso remember it not just my name or donald trump name on the ballot it the kind of country we want it every issue anyone cares about so if you believe america thrives when the middle class thrives then you have to vote tomorrow if you believe we should make the biggest investment in new jobs since world war ii in infrastructure advanced manufacturing clean energy small business then you have to vote if you believe we need more fairness in our economy to raise the minimum wage because no one who works fulltime should still be in poverty then you have to vote if you believe we need to do more to support working families with affordable childcare paid leave and equal pay for women then you have to vote and remember when my opponent says every time i talk about these issues that im playing the woman card well you know what i say deal me in and if you believe if you believe all kids deserve good schools with good teachers no matter what house they live in you have to vote and if you believe college should be more affordable you have to vote bernie sanders and i worked on a plan to make public colleges and universities tuitionfree if you earn less than 125000 and debtfree for everybody else and for the millions of americans struggling with student debt we are going to help you pay that down and pay that off if you believe in science and that weve got to address climate change you have to vote if you believe we need to reform our criminal justice system so everyone is treated fairly then you have to vote and if you believe  if you believe we should never write discrimination into our laws well then you know you know north carolina youve got to vote to get rid of hb2!\n\nnow this is so energizing we could keep going with a long list but here what  here what else i want you to know a good thing this election didnt land during exams that all i can say look tomorrow  tomorrow night this election will end but i want you to understand our work together will be just beginning we have to bridge the divides in this country as the bible says we have to repair the breaches weve got to be willing to start listening to each other again respecting each other again and i want to thank gaga because she has always stood for that fundamental principle of respecting everybody\n\nso i want you to know and i want you to spread the word i do want to be president for all americans not just some not just the people who support me and vote for me i want to be president for everyone because we all have a role to play in building that better future for our country and for each of you\n\nso if you havent voted yesterday go to iwillvotecom you can get all the info you need and you can still sign up to volunteer right go to hillaryclintoncom or text join join to 47246 or stop by one of our offices we would welcome you to help make sure everybody gets out to vote tomorrow because none of us want to wake up wednesday morning and wish we had done more right\n\nand years from today when your kids and grandkids ask what you did in 2016 when everything was on the line youll be able to say you voted for a stronger fairer better america an america where we build bridges not walls and where we prove conclusively that yes love trumps hate! thank you! let go vote north carolina! god bless you! thank you all very much!
37,thank you! boy! wow! thank you! wow! did anybody see that debate last night oh yes one down two to go i am so excited to be back here at wake tech i was here 8 years ago and i was so impressed then with the kinds of programs and opportunities that are offered here to people like christine that i wanted to come back of course to raleigh but i wanted to come back here to wake tech when christine was talking i was backstage watching her on a screen we had there and she kept saying about how she was about to cry i was about to cry her story says so much not just about her but about our country we are a country of second chances and third and fourth chances for people willing to work for them get up every day do their best that\ the basic bargain of america and i was really proud of christine\n\nthank you thank you and i think her  i think her patients at duke regional are in for a treat because not only the skills that she learned here at wake tech but that personality that getupandgo personality is going to mean a lot to the people she\ taking care of so christine thank you and godspeed\n\nnow i have to thank  i have to thank dr stephen scott the president of wake tech community college all the administrators the faculty and the students of wake tech now dr scott told me that the enrollment\ about 73000 and what a tribute to what this institution represents and i am a huge huge supporter i just see america differently i think there\ nothing we can\t do if we make our minds up roll up our sleeves get working together support institutions like wake tech support people like christine and that\ what i intend to do\n\nnow i want to thank your mayor mayor mcfarlane thank you so much for being here state senator dan blue jr i also want to recognize linda coleman candidate for lieutenant governor of north carolina linda came so close last time and this time are you going to bring her over the finish line and i\ll tell you somebody else i\m really excited about that is the democratic candidate for the senate former state representative deborah ross i have watched  i have watched the campaign she\ run and the intensity and the incredible passion that she brings to it i\ll tell you what we sure could use her in washington representative north carolina i want to thank all the elected officials who are here and i want to do a special shoutout to a longtime friend of my husband\ and mine somebody who we admire so much who did really transform this state during his governorship that\ former governor jim hunt\n\nthank you! boy! wow! thank you! wow! did anybody see that debate last night oh yes one down two to go i am so excited to be back here at wake tech i was here 8 years ago and i was so impressed then with the kinds of programs and opportunities that are offered here to people like christine that i wanted to come back of course to raleigh but i wanted to come back here to wake tech when christine was talking i was backstage

and mine somebody who we admire so much who did really transform this state during his governorship that\ former governor jim hunt\n\nnow there\ a lot that i want to talk about today but let me start with this because you may or may not know today is national voter registration day and you see some signs people are holding \i will vote\ now that\ not only a great sign that shows you\re committed to vote but it\ a website and you can go to iwillvotecom to make sure you are registered and i hope you all will and i hope you\ll tell everybody that you know to do the same because we want to make sure people are registered\n\nand there is still time to get registered here in north carolina and i hope that you will because think about everything that\ at stake in this election right here in north carolina the very meanspirited wrongheaded decision by your legislature and governor to pass and sign house bill 2 has hurt this state but more than that it\ hurt people it has sent a message to so many people that well you\re not really wanted you\re not really part of us i think the american dream is big enough for everybody\n\nthe other thing your governor and legislature did was everything they could to make voting harder for people now they were pretty blatant about it make it harder for people of color make it harder for the elderly and make it harder for the young now some of that\ been rolled back thankfully because it was so wrong and i would argue unconstitutional but the best way to show hey in a democracy like ours we can have the most vigorous vibrant debate that\ what it\ about but we want everybody to exercise his or her right to vote that\ the way we\re supposed to be making decisions it distorts our democracy if some groups of people try to prevent other people from being able to do that\n\nnow i have won elections and i have lost elections so i know what the difference is but i\ll tell you this i believe in what our founders established for us to govern ourselves to continue to widen the circle of opportunity and that includes the opportunity to be heard to express yourself your voice and your vote and the best way to reaffirm our commitment to that fundamental american value is to show up and vote and demonstrate the importance of your vote\n\ni believe that we may have a recordsetting turnout in this election some folks who follow this are saying we could have the biggest turnout we\ve ever had now that kind of makes sense because you could not have two more different visions about where we want our country to go in the future and who we are fighting for but early information is actually quite encouraging we\re seeing spikes in early voting and we\re seeing voting rates among african americans latinos and young people going up and for the first time the estimate is that young people could represent 25 percent of the vote\n\nnow i would love to see that obviously i hope people vote for me but i would love to see that because every election is about the future and honestly it\ more about the future of young people and children than it\ ever been because of the difference in the approaches and the experiences of me and my opponent\n\nnow last night i got a chance  i got a chance to say a few things about what i want to do if i\m so fortunate enough to be elected as your president and i do have this oldfashioned idea that if i\m asking for your vote i should tell you what i want to do and i also got to convey my excitement about what we can do together you see i really think the central question in this election is what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we want to build for our children and our grandchildren\n\nand i also got to convey my excitement about what we can do together you see i really think the central question in this election is what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we want to build for our children and our grandchildren i think about that a lot in part because i started out working for the children\ defense fund it\ always been my passion about what we can do  to help more kids live up to their godgiven potential\n\nand during this campaign people have asked me \well how did you get interested in that\and the simple answer is my mother had such a neglected childhood she was basically abandoned by her parents sent to live with grandparents who didn\t want her by the age of 14 she was out on her own working in a home babysitting keeping house she was basically a maid and when i think about my mother\ own life and how she told me when i was old enough to understand how different her life was than the one that she created for me and my brothers she would say she was so often saved by the kindness of other people\n\nwe overlook the importance of just how we treat each other the respect we show the kindness the love that we show and i\m well aware that\ not something you put necessarily on a campaign website but i\ve been talking about it because i think we\ve got to reassert our fundamental connection to each other\n\nwhen my mother was in first grade she never had any food and her first grade teacher noticed that in those days they just brought food a little bag of food then they\d sit in the classroom and eat it and my mother never had any food and that first grade teacher noticed that and began to bring extra food but without embarrassing her she would say \you know dorothy i brought too much food would you like this sandwich would you like this milk\ and it wasn\t until she herself was much older that my mother realized that that teacher fed her for that school year something she didn\t have to do but her love for her students her recognition of a child who wasn\t well taken care of meant that she stepped in\n\nand then when my mother worked as a maid she really wanted to go to high school she started working right before she would have been in high school because she had to get out of her grandparents\ home and the woman she worked for realized how much my mother wanted to go to high school and so she said to her \if you get up early  it sounds like christine getting up so early if you get up early and you get your chores done you can go to high school\ and that\ what my mother did for four years she got up early and then she literally had to run run to get to high school it sounds harsh but not for my mom she thought it was such a great gift of kindness that this woman gave her a place to live gave her food to eat gave her the chance to go to high school\n\nso when i talk about us being stronger together i\m not just talking about what our government needs to do i\m talking about what each of us can do to contribute we do need to make sure  we need to make sure that our economy does work for everyone not just those at the top and that means we\ve got to make investments in more good new jobs infrastructure jobs advanced manufacturing jobs technology and innovation clean renewable energy jobs and we\ve got to do more to help small businesses because that\ where most of the new jobs will come from\n\nas i said last night my dad was a small businessman when he got out of the navy after world war ii he started this small business printing drapery fabrics and he had a print plant in chicago it was just  it was dark room there was no natural light he had two long tables and he\d spread that fabric on the table and then he would take silkscreens  if you\ve ever seen one  and he\d start at one end and he\d put it down he\d pour the paint in and he\d take the squeegee and he\d lift it up and he\d go all the way down to the end of one table and then he\d start on the other table and he would do that until he got the job done and i would help him out from time to time so i knew how hard he worked but he was so proud that he could give us a good middle class life because his dad was a factory worker and so he was able to do what we want to see in america keep going keep reaching move as high as your hard work and ambition will take you\n\nso i want us to have an economy that works for everyone to grow the economy to create more jobs but i also want a fairer economy because  when you work hard you should not be still in poverty at the end of the year but if you are a minimum wage worker if you work full time minimum wage you will make 15000 a year twothirds of minimum wage workers are women most of them with families to support and i\ve talked to a lot of these women sometimes i\ll be at a cafe or sometimes i\ll be in a store and i\ll just start talking to them and they will tell me  it\ one of the most humbling experiences about being out there talking to people is that if you\re open to it folks will tell you what\ on their minds and their hearts\n\nso i\ve met women who are working two fulltime minimum wage jobs to make enough to be able to support their kids so we need to raise the national minimum wage and  and we need to guarantee finally equal pay for women\ work because  number one it\ fair it\ fair and if your mother your wife your sister or your daughter is working don\t you want to see her paid what she should be paid for the work she does\n\nand the other thing i want to do i want to make sure that more companies offer profitsharing to their employees who help make the profits in the first place it makes no sense to me that sharing in profits would only go to the top executives i want more people in more jobs to realize the benefit of their hard work\n\nand last night at the debate one of my guests was mark cuban now mark cuban who is a real billionaire by the way he has used profitsharing from his very first successful business and he not only used it while the business was going but when the business was sold he shared the profits from the sale and made 300 of his employees millionaires overnight\n\nnow that\ the kind of business leadership i want to hold up because what we\ve seen from my opponent is someone who his own campaign manager has said builds a lot of businesses on the back of the little guy stiffing people  dishwashers painters plumbers architects glass installers marble installers drapery installers  across america some of them have come forward you can go to our website you can see their stories it\ heartbreaking and as i said last night i\m really glad my dad never had a contract with donald trump when he was running his small business\n\nand in addition to making the economy fair we\ve got to make it work better for working families who are trying to balance family and work it\ really hard out there isn\t it and just listening to christine\ story  getting up at 400 and studying getting kids up at 700 going to school going to work going to another job  that\ not an uncommon story we\ve made it really hard for a lot of people\n\nso here\ what i think we need to do and it\ not a luxury it\ a necessity  because i want more families to be able to go as far as their hard work will take them and i\ve heard so many stories they\ve told me  people have told me about the difficult choices they face and the stresses they\re under so let\ finally since every other advanced economy has already done this let\ have paid family leave so that when you\re sick or your spouse or your child is sick or you have a newborn you can take care of your loved ones and let\ have earned sick days so that you don\t lose your job because you\re sick or you go to work because you\re sick and let\ finally have affordable childcare which in lots of states costs as much or more than instate college tuition i don\t think any family should ever have to pay more than 10 percent of your income for childcare and we\re going to fix that so that becomes the norm and then let\ make sure that every educational opportunity is available without sending you into debt and breaking your budget\n\nnow tomorrow in new hampshire bernie sanders and i are going to talk about the college plan for debtfree college at public universities that he and i have worked on since the end of our primary and i want  i want every family in north carolina to know help is on the way and we\re also going to work so that you can refinance the debt you already have at much lower rates and get it paid off a lot sooner\n\nnow how are we going to do that well we\re going to go where the money is and the money is at the top we\re going to go after millionaires billionaires and corporations we\re going to raise taxes on millionaires and billionaires and we\re going to close corporate loopholes and i believe that we can get that done in part because you\re going to send deborah ross to the senate so we\re going to have another democratic senator but also because our government needs to start working for everybody again  not just those who have lobbyists and lawyers and influence that hasn\t worked out so well we\ve got to get back to first principles our job is to give the maximum opportunities to the maximum number of americans and to especially focus on people who are working their way out of poverty and people in the middle class who want to go as far as they can go let\ be a government for the struggling the striving and the successful\n\nso i\m excited about what we can do i really am and i\m going to leave it to the factcheckers to go through all of  all of donald trump\ claims there were  there was a lot of work for factcheckers last night but here\ a couple of things that caught my attention he actually bragged about gaming the system to get out of paying his fair share of taxes in fact i think there\ a strong probability he hasn\t paid federal taxes a lot of years and this is a man who goes around calling our military a disaster who goes around criticizing every institution from health care to education our vets but he probably hasn\t paid a penny to support our troops or our vets or our schools or our health care systems\n\nand when i confronted him with the reasons why he won\t release his tax returns  and i got to that point where i said well maybe he\ paid zero  he said that makes him smart now if not paying taxes makes him smart what does that make all the rest of us i got to tell you bill and i have been blessed we didn\t come from millionaire families my husband\ father  his biological father died before he was born his mother went to nursing school in order to support him they struggled they worked hard and america gave him the chance to get a good education pursue his dreams end up being president my dad as i told you worked hard\n\nso bill and i have released all of our tax returns going back 40 years and if you look you\ll see that we paid the highest marginal rate we tried to give 10 percent to charity because we believe in this country and we believe with the blessings that we\ve been given we should do our part\n\nthe other thing he admitted last night was that he actually rooted for the housing crisis to happen i don\t think i\d make a big bragging point out of that but he seemed to feel like hey it shows you how smart i am he basically said \yeah if the housing market crashes i can go in and buy stuff and make some more money\ i got to tell you what kind of person believes that what kind of person would want to root for nine million families losing their homes one who should never be president is the answer to that question\n\nand he made it very clear that he didn\t prepare for that debate at one point he was kind of digging me for spending time off the campaign trail to get prepared but just trying to keep track of everything he says took a lot of time and effort and i said \yeah you know what i did prepare and i\ll tell you something else i prepared for i prepared to be president of the united states and i think that\ good\\n\nso as i said in the beginning we have two different visions here i believe we are stronger together that is at the core of what i\ve done over my years in advocacy and public service i believe that america is already great and it is our responsibility to make it even greater i believe that as we make our economy work for everyone we also need to keep our country safe and we need to provide strong steady leadership in the world with our allies and our partners i\ve laid out my views on a range of national security and foreign policy issues i\ve laid out my plan for defeating and destroying isis and what we hear from my opponent is dangerously incoherent it\ unclear exactly what he is saying\n\nbut words matter and last night it sounded like he was basically telling our treaty allies in asia hey we\re not sure we\re going to be there for you even though we have a mutual defense treaty words matter people here that and they start to doubt america\ word america\ intention i felt like i had to jump in and say \i just want to be clear we will honor our treaties we will support our allies and our partners\\n\nthis is not reality tv this is real it\ as real as it gets so we\re going to get the economy working for everybody not just those at the top we\re going to keep america safe provide strong steady leadership and we are going to bring our country together across the divides that have pitted americans against each other economic worries are not the only ones keeping families up at night are they there\ still a lot we don\t know about the recent incidents in tulsa and charlotte but this we do know we\ve got to bring communities together we have to listen to each other we have to make it clear that everyone is safer when there is respect from the law for the communities they protect and respect for the law from the communities that are protected\n\nand we\ve got to do something about the epidemic of gun violence that has taken too many too many lives in our country again i think we can come together a very long majority of americans and a majority of gun owners believe in comprehensive background checks they believe in the second amendment as i do they believe in the right of individuals to have guns as i do but they believe along with me that we should not let guns fall into the wrong hands of people who will use them to kill other people and make it so easy to get them\n\nso there\ work to do but it\ great work it\ important work starting right here in north carolina we have 42 days left this election\ going to be close they all are these days that\ why every call you make every door you knock on every friend you register to vote to make the difference i want you if you can to text \join\ join to 47246 or go to hillaryclintoncom and sign up to volunteer here in north carolina and i know there\ a big overflow room and i\m told they can hear me so to my friends in the overflow we want you to be just as involved as anyone else thank you for coming\n\nso remember here in north carolina starting on october 20th you can register and vote early at the same time at any onestop early voting site in your county and remember it\ not just the presidential race it\ the governor\ race the lieutenant governor\ race the us senate race and other races up and down the ticket because we want to prove who we are as americans in this election we\re not fearful we don\t want to build walls we want to build bridges we don\t want to turn against each other we want to work with one another we want to set big goals again here in our country\n\ni\ve got some big goals that i know we can achieve take climate change which my opponent says is a hoax perpetrated by the chinese i think it could be one of the biggest economic opportunities our country has ever seen and i want us to take advantage of that do the right thing and benefit from it that\ what i\m offering we\re going to deploy a half a billion more solar panels in the first four years of my administration and we will produce enough clean power to power every home in america within 10 years and we\re going to lead the world because some country is going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century now the way things are stacking up i think it\ either going to be germany china or us i want it to be us and it will be us\n\nthat is exactly right i love this country i\m proud of this country i want to be a leader who brings people together in our country sets those goals gets about the business of achieving them and proves once and for all that love trumps hate thank you!
38,thank you so much! thank you wow thank you all what a great way to celebrate my birthday being here in tampa!\ni am so so grateful to josh for that wonderful introduction he\ an incredibly talented chef but more than that i have to say he\ a humanitarian he just came back from haiti once again where he goes periodically to help feed people he\ been doing it ever since the terrible earthquake going to help people in remote villages  and he does that all over the world when it comes to making sure that there are clean cookstoves so that people can cook primarily women and children without fear of getting sick from inhaling all the smoke i enlisted joshâ\x95s help when i was secretary of state on the clean cookstoves initiative and as you heard he\ also a proud immigrant and  he is standing up to donald trump\ antiimmigrant rhetoric and he\ doing it in a very courageous way because he sacrificed his business he\d been asked by the trump organization to put a restaurant into the new hotel that trump was talking about on tv today in washington and after josh heard the kinds of things that donald trump was saying about immigrants he said \no i refuse to open a restaurant in that hotel\ that is really gutsy\n\nand today was a perfect time to have josh be with us because as i said donald trump is taking time off the campaign trail to officially open the hotel and yesterday here in florida he took time out to invite the press to listen to his employees talk about what a great boss he is while he was watching and listening to them\n\nand today in opening that hotel i think it\ important to note that he once again relied on undocumented workers the same people he has been insulting and demonizing throughout this campaign so like with so much else that donald trump says he says one thing and then he does something different many of the products in the hotel were made overseas rather than here in the united states and he even sued the district of columbia to pay lower taxes that is the way that he does business\n\nnow we\ve actually learned in this campaign that donald trump is the poster boy for everything wrong with our economy he refuses to pay workers and contractors from atlantic city to miami to las vegas he stiffs small businesses i take that one personally because my dad was a small businessman and i\ve met so many people who did projects for donald trump  provided pianos for one of his casinos installed drapes for one of his hotels laid the marble put in the glass washed the dishes painted  and then weren\t paid i just think that is fundamentally wrong and that is not the kind of experience we need in the oval office\n\nso i\m grateful to josh and i want to thank everyone else  my great friend your united states senator bill nelson congresswoman kathy castor mayor bob buckhorn who\ here with his two daughters governor charlie crist soon to be congressman charlie crist i have to say we\ve got two great candidates here david singer candidate for the house of representatives and rena frazier another candidate and we have the great talent of angela bassett with us today\n\nso my friends here\ the advice that i got it is a beautiful day in tampa but it\ warm and some of you have been here a while right and i\m watching the flags so long as they\re waving i know there\ a breeze if they stop waving i\m really going to cut this short\n\nbut let me start by thanking you  thanking you for being here\n\nthank you thank you well i\ll tell you if i ever need a pickup i\m coming back to tampa mayor and with 13 days left in this election we cannot stop for a minute no complacency here nobody nobody flagging we\ve got to get everybody out to vote and i hope in addition to the people that i\ve mentioned someone who\ not here i hope you will support  that is congressman patrick murphy to send him to the united states senate\n\ni think you\ll be pleased because he\ an independent voice he\ a problemsolver he believes in comprehensive immigration reform he has stood with planned parenthood against the attacks that it has suffered he has even brought democrats and republicans together to try to protect our environment and fund everglades restoration he\ll stand up to the gun lobby and advocate for common sense gun safety measures he\ll defend social security and medicare not cutting or privatizing those two essential programs so please do your best to make sure we send patrick murphy to the senate\n\nnow i got to ask you anybody see the last debate you know i have now stood next to donald trump for four and a half hours proving conclusively i have the stamina to do the job\n\nand every time he says one of those outrageous things that he does have a  yeah \wrong\  he does have a way of saying i just keep remembering michelle obama\ words when he goes low we go high\n\nbut i got to say he said something in the last debate we\ve never heard from anybody running for president he basically said that he\ not sure  he refused to say that he would respect the results of the election now this is a guy who said the emmys were rigged so you can\t really take what he says very seriously but this is a problem because the first thing a president does at noon on january 20th is to take an oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution and if you are casting doubts you want to keep people in suspense as to whether you will respect the outcome of an election that is contrary to who we are as americans we have our elections we\ve had them from george washington forward we\re going to keep having them and show what a democracy looks like to the rest of the world\n\ni believe strongly that the american people are going to reject this dark divisive vision of america and it\ happening my friends we have reached a milestone more than 200 million americans are registered to vote that\ the biggest number ever and that number includes 50 million young people and you know what else more than 10 million people have already voted including 2 million right here in florida\n\ni\m hearing some great stories from people let me just tell you one it\ about steven from st augustine he\ been fighting a rare form of leukemia and heart disease he\ been in and out of the hospitals a dozen times in the last two years but he knows how important his vote is so i heard yesterday he ditched his oxygen tank which i would not have recommended  clung to his walker stood in line so he could cast his vote for a better america and if steven can do that nobody has any excuses and i think this extends not just to democrats but to republicans and independents and i am proud to have support from republicans and independents here across florida and across america who agree with me that we should reject hate and division\n\nwe have seen donald trump insult nearly every person in america and i just find that so intolerable because look at this diverse crowd look at tampa it\ a cosmopolitan city florida is paving the way for what our country will look like and we need to be lifting each other up listening to each other respecting each other not sowing seeds of hatred and bigotry and i think one of my biggest jobs after this election will be bringing our country together and i\m going to need your help\n\nwe\re going to get the economy working for everybody not just people at the top with new jobs in infrastructure that rail system bob that you want we\re going to get it because it would help you so much think of the people we\d put to work  technology innovation research advanced manufacturing and yes small business i want to be the best small business president you can have to help people start and grow their businesses but we\re also going to make america the clean energy superpower of the 21st century i know we can create millions of jobs and we can protect florida especially coastal florida and we can protect our planet at the same time you\re already seeing the results of climate change here in florida i was just in miami and they actually have flooding on sunny days with no rain people are calling 311 because they think a water main broke but it\ the oceans rising so i know there is no state that could benefit more from a clean energy agenda than florida and that\ exactly what we\re going to do\n\nwe\re also going to make public colleges and universities tuitionfree if your family makes less than 125000 which is most families in america you\re not going to have to pay a penny to go to a public college or university if your family makes more than that you\re not going to have to go into debt  pay what you can afford and then we\re going to make sure you can go without getting a big debt because that drags people down and for people who already have debt we are going to help you refinance it and pay it off\n\nand i want to say something to all of the teachers and educators i want to work with you and be a good partner with you and i think there should be more than one way more than just a fouryear college degree to get a good job with a good middleclass life for you and your families so let\ invest in more technical education in high school in our community colleges let\ have more apprenticeship programs  labor and business together\n\nbut while we grow the economy let\ make it fairer we need to raise the national minimum wage so that people who work fulltime aren\t left in poverty i got to tell you i was raised to believe in hard work my grandfather was a factory worker my dad had a small business and we really believed you\ve got to work for what you get in life right but if you\re working you shouldn\t be at the point where you cannot even afford food or clothes or rent at the end of the year\n\nand isn\t it finally time to guarantee equal pay for women\ work you know this is not just a women\ issue this is a family issue if you\ve got a mother a wife a sister or a daughter working it\ your issue and unlike my opponent we\re going to ask the wealthy the millionaires and billionaires to pay their fair share because we\re going to close the loopholes and make sure no multimillionaire ever pays a lower tax rate than a nurse or a teacher or a police officer or a firefighter and i will not raise taxes on anyone making less than 250000 a year\n\nso when you go to the polls vote to grow the economy more jobs with rising incomes vote to make the economy fairer and compare that with what my opponent has proposed he really believes if you give trillions  that\ trillions with a \t\  trillions in tax cuts to the wealthy millionaires billionaires big corporations everything will trickle down now we know that doesn\t work we\ve seen it and it\ pretty rich coming from a guy who claims to be so rich who hasn\t paid a dime in federal income taxes in 20 years he says not making taxes makes him smart well i don\t know i don\t know how smart you have to be to lose a billion dollars in one year and besides what kind of genius loses money running a casino for heaven\ sakes\n\nactually it sounds like a few people have been at casinos here but this means he\ contributed zero okay he actually has the gall to call our military a disaster not only is he wrong but what right does he have to say that he hasn\t contributed a penny to our military not a penny to our veterans not a penny to health care or education not a penny to highways or infrastructure this is a false  false  charge that he makes about all the problems in our country\n\nand i\ll tell you something we did a little research he\ been denigrating america for decades this didn\t start with his birther lie against president obama it didn\t even start running against me back in 1987 he took out a 100000 ad in the new york times criticizing president reagan he said our leaders were the laughing stock of the world so this is a guy who criticizes everybody but himself and at some point you got to say wait a minute we\re better than that we are stronger than that we want to forward  forward  into the future with confidence and optimism and that\ what we\re offering in this campaign\n\ni got to tell you it is not just what we\re against that should motivate you to go to the polls it\ what we are for and i believe strongly that what we\re for will make it possible for all of us and especially our kids and our grandkids to have the best future america\ best days can still be ahead of us but we can\t make any of this happen if we don\t have you voting\n\nnow donald trump says he can still win and he\ right that\ why it\ so important everyone gets out and votes and here in florida  in a lot of places you can only vote on election day but here in florida voting couldn\t be easier early voting began on monday in south florida it goes through sunday november 6 around the state you can go to an early voting site between 700 am and 700 pm in fact the county center on east kennedy boulevard is just a 10minute walk from here you can go vote right after this event and we\ll have staff ready to help you get there and you can go to iwillvotecom to confirm your polling place and make a plan to vote\n\nbut i also hope you will volunteer these last two weeks we\re reaching out to everybody so go to hillaryclintoncom and sign up to volunteer take out your phone and text join and that is 47246 we can use you we\re making millions of phone calls in florida we\re knocking on maybe by the time we finish millions of doors\n\nwe don\t want anybody to be left out or left behind because on january 20th america will have a new president i\ve got to say  so i\ve got to say to you that change is inevitable in life right and so the real question is what kind of change are we going to have and i want you to talk to anybody you know who is either thinking of not voting or maybe thinking of voting for my opponent no i\m serious i\m serious after this election if i\m fortunate enough to be elected we are going to reach out to everybody right and ask ask the people you\re talking to what kind of change they really want because i don\t think most americans want the kind of divisive and dark change donald trump is offering mass deportations that will rip families apart a repeal of gunfree school zones on day one going back to the day when insurance companies could discriminate against us if we have a preexisting condition letting wall street write its own rules denying the science of climate change rolling back marriage equality defunding planned parenthood the hugest tax breaks ever for the wealthy and abroad abandoning our alliances and allowing more countries to get nuclear weapons\n\n\nnow that may be change but boy that\ not the change we need and my vision is different it\ more hopeful optimistic and unifying i want us to be a country where every student could afford to go to college if that\ what you choose i want us to be a country where millions of people are working in good highpaying jobs and in new industries like clean energy and advanced manufacturing i want us to be a country where hardworking immigrants who pay taxes  and by the way onehalf of undocumented workers pay federal income taxes which means they are paying more federal income taxes than donald trump paid and a country where we not only have equal pay for our work but affordable childcare where we\re respected in the world working with our allies to defeat terrorism and stop the spread of nuclear weapons so yes change is coming the choice is yours about what kind of change we\ll have\n\nand i hope you will choose to be part of this campaign because it\ not just about winning on november 8th as important as that is it is about getting to work because i do believe we are stronger together\n\ntim kaine and i wrote a book laying out our agenda because i think you deserve to know what i will try to do as your president so if you will help we will come together to give every american the chance to chart your own future and contribute to our great country\n\nlet\ prove once and for all that love trumps hate\n\nthank you
39,hello toledo i am  i am very happy to be here today and  i am so grateful to have this chance to talk to you about what we can do together to have the kind of economy that works for everyone not just those at the top\ni want to acknowledge  we have an overflow crowd in another room and i know they can hear us but we\re glad they\re here i want to thank your congresswoman marcy kaptur for her leadership and her grit i want to thank mayor paula hickshudson and the mayor told me there\ a young man here who just won a boxing championship robert easter where\ robert easter there you are robert easter congratulations i know toledo is proud of you we all are i want to thank kenyetta for that introduction do we have any other uaw members here\n\nit\ a great day to be here in ohio for a lot of different reasons one is i am so thrilled that lebron james has endorsed me and joined our campaign i know  i\ve gotten a lot of wonderful endorsements over the past year and a half i\m grateful for each and every one of them but i got to say there\ something special about this one and it\ a real honor in part because of why he chose to endorse me now not everyone knows this i mean you all know what an amazing athlete he his  mvp winner of championships  but he\ also  lebron is also a dedicated advocate for children and this afternoon i\ll be in akron where he\ done so much for the kids in that community\n\nit\ a deep personal commitment that he has that i share with him we both believe every single child should have the chance to live up to his or her godgiven potential i could not be prouder to have lebron joining our team as we head into the homestretch\n\nnow one thing i know  i\ll just say it because i know it\ for sure  i hope to be elected president but i know here in ohio lebron will always be the king\n\ni was listening to kenyetta introduce me and i really appreciated what she said because toledo is the kind of place where people work hard look after one another and yes pay their taxes right\n\nyou recognize that we all have to do our part because we are all in this together and it matters\n\nwe believe honest work deserves honest pay we believe everyone should have the right to join a strong union that will always have your back\n\nit\ personal for me i\m the granddaughter of a factory worker from scranton pennsylvania he went to work in the same lace mill every day for 50 years he believed he passed it down to my dad who passed it down to me that if he did what he was supposed to do he\d have a good life and his kids would have an even better life that is the american dream that is what we believe in that\ what we\ve got to keep going generation after generation\n\nand because of my grandfather\ hard work my dad made it to college and then after serving in the navy during world war ii he started his own small business printing fabric for draperies\n\nas a young girl i\d sometimes go to his print plant it was a long building no natural light no windows but he had these long tables where he\d roll out the fabric and then i\d watch him work with silkscreens if you\ve ever seen that he would take the silkscreen he\d put it down he\d pour the paint in he\d take the squeegee go across all the way down to the end of one table then over to the next table all the way back and then if there was a second color to be added he would do that he sometimes let me help with the squeegee that was my favorite part\n\nand i know he worked really hard he worked really hard he believed in hard work he passed that on to me he provided a good middleclass life for us so i am proud to stand with hardworking families all over toledo ohio and america who should have the same chance that i did to share in the american dream which should be big enough for everybody\n\nfighting for kids and families has been the cause of my life as kenyetta said when i went to work for the children\ defense fund all those years ago and it will be the mission of my presidency because i want to focus on what are called kitchen table issues the ones that keep you up at night  like the cost of child care and college and prescription drugs and so much else\n\nand that means we\ve got to create more good jobs with rising incomes that means we\ve got to have good schools in every zip code that means everybody willing to work  and i say that very clearly you\ve got to be willing to work  and if you\re willing to work you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead that is the basic bargain\n\nnow i don\t know about you but you wouldn\t think that the theme of my campaign \getting an economy to work for everyone not just those at the top\ would be controversial  and yet this is one of the defining debates not just of this election but of our time\n\nnow i will say most american companies  most  are run by honorable patriotic people who care about their employees and communities but there are still too many powerful interests fighting to protect their own profits and privileges at the expense of everyone else  and they are aided and abetted by the rules and incentives in our economy who actually encourage people at the top to take advantage of consumers workers small businesses and taxpayers\n\nthat makes it tougher for the wellmeaning ceos to take the high road and it gets even harder when we don\t aggressively enforce the rules when we don\t enforce trade rules that allow other countries with lower wages and standards to get an unfair leg up when we don\t enforce rules on wall street which exerts enormous pressure on publicly traded companies to prioritize boosting share prices in the short term over building real value investing in workers plant and equipment over the longer term\n\nand let\ be honest the tax code rewards corporations for outsourcing jobs and their profits overseas instead of investing here in the united states and it is riddled with loopholes that let the rich get even richer and make income inequality even worse it tilts the playing field further against small businesses that can\t afford lawyers and lobbyists\n\nso with all these pressures pushing in the wrong direction it\ even more important that we have an election about these very issues because what i know will happen  if we have an election where we have an agenda that actually would begin to level that playing field we will rebuild the middle class we will make work pay we will create greater opportunities for a great percentage of americans\n\nnow i know how hard this but i think we are on the cusp if we win this election to be able to get these things done right\n\nthat means pursuing reforms that unleash the enormous positive potential of the american private sector we\ve got unmatched talent innovation entrepreneurial spirit\n\nso when we work together we can all benefit\n\nnow i believe corporations that benefit from everything america has to offer should feel some sense of responsibility not just to their biggest shareholders  but to their workers to their customers to their communities and yes to our country to the united states of america we have been moving off track for decades i don\t need to tell you that you know it you\ve lived it you\ve seen it but it is time to get back on track\n\nand you can ask anybody who\ ever worked for me or worked with me who\ ever served with me when i tell you i\m going to try to do something i will get up every single day and work my heart out for you\n\nso let\ begin by making it clear that for most businesses america is the most important asset on their balance sheet this country of ours this system of ours the rule of law the opportunity to get an education and go as far as your hard work and ambition will take you and we created the biggest engine of economic growth in the world the american middle class so when we middle class thrives the country thrives and when it doesn\t we don\t right\n\nand i\m going to use the white house and every tool at my disposal as your president to make the case that patriotism is profitable standing up for america investing in america will pay off\n\nnow we have always had innovators and entrepreneurs who build great companies and create real value but we should not and we will not respect those who get rich by cheating everybody else\n\nso today i want to send a clear message to every boardroom every executive suite across america if you scam your customers exploit your employees pollute our environment or rip off taxpayers we will find ways to hold you accountable\n\nbut on the other side  on the other side if you do the right thing and you invest in your workers and your communities and our country\ future we will stand with you that is the choice our goal is to make it easier for everyone to do better\n\nnow to understand why this is so important consider the recent examples we\ve seen of egregious corporate behavior\n\nlook at wells fargo really shocking isn\t it one of the nation\ biggest banks bullying thousands of employees into committing fraud against unsuspecting customers secretly opening up millions of accounts for people without their consent even their knowledge misusing personal information and then sticking customers with hidden fees it is outrageous that eight years after a cowboy culture on wall street wrecked our economy we are still seeing powerful bankers playing fast and loose with the law\n\nand then in a category by himself there\ donald trump well you may have heard that he has long refused to release his tax returns the way every other nominee for president has done for decades you can look at 40 years of my tax returns i think we need a law that says if you become the nominee of the major parties you have to release your tax returns\n\nnow a lot of us were wondering what is he hiding it must be really terrible well the new york times has discovered at least part of the answer back in the 1990s trump apparently lost a billion dollars in a single year on bad investments and failing casinos now how anybody can lose a dollar let alone a billion dollars in the casino industry is kind of beyond me it\ just hard to figure but as a result it doesn\t look like he paid a dime of federal income tax for almost two decades\n\nnow while millions of american families including mine and yours were working hard paying our fair share it seems he was contributing nothing to our nation imagine that not fair nothing for pell grants to help kids go to college nothing for veterans nothing for our military and you know he has been dissing america in this whole campaign right he talks us down he makes disparaging comments about our country he calls our military a disaster well it\ not but it might have been if everybody else had failed to pay taxes to support our brave men and women in uniform\n\ni saw a newspaper article a gentleman named steve crouse who owns the glass city cafe here in toledo summed it up pretty well in this article he said \i would feel guilty if i didn\t pay anything it\ flatout cheating the government\ now my friend bernie sanders was right yesterday when he said trump reflects a distorted view of the american people and what this country is all about\n\ntrump represents the same rigged system that he claims he\ going to change the whole story tells us everything we need to know about how trump does business after he made all those bad bets and lost all that money he didn\t lift a finger to help and protect his employees or all the small businesses and contractors he\d hired or the people of atlantic city they all got hammered while he was busy with his accountants trying to figure out how he could keep living like a billionaire and all the while he was using his political connections to collect hundreds of millions of dollars in government subsidies and extra tax breaks for his companies in other words trump was taking from america with both hands and leaving the rest of us with the bill\n\nnow he says that he\ the one who can fix things but that is like letting the fox guard the henhouse right and here\ what i really am just stunned by i get stunned every day in this campaign but here\ one of the many things that i\m stunned by he has put forth a tax plan that would cut his own taxes even more it would be like you\re paying zero you expect us to pay you to stay in business all the rest of us in america he\d open the loopholes even wider and according to a new independent study he would actually  listen to this people because this is a real shocker  his plan would actually raise taxes for millions of middle class families and you know the people it would hit the hardest are single parents whose lives and challenges he doesn\t care about certainly doesn\t understand\n\nnow many have likely already spent years paying more than he did and he now would make that even worse and what does he say about it well did you all see the debate last monday well in the debate  in the debate  well then you all know that in the debate he said it was smart to avoid paying taxes yesterday his campaign was bragging it makes him a genius here\ my question what kind of genius loses a billion dollars in a single year\n\nthis is trump to a t he\ taken corporate excess and makes a business model out of it he abuses his power games the system puts his own interests ahead of the country\ it\ trump first and everyone else last and there are lots of principled lawabiding business leaders out there who are horrified by all of this not a single  not a single ceo of a fortune 100 company supports trump\ campaign think about it i\ve been endorsed by very successful people  warren buffett mike bloomberg mark cuban i loved what mark cuban said when he endorsed me he said \look i\ve been successful\ he actually is a real billionaire and you know what he used profitsharing to help his employees not bankruptcy to fire people and when he sold his first company he shared the profits with his employees and 300 of them became millionaires that\ the kind of business practices i want to see more of in our country\n\nbut here\ what we\ve got to do even if trump is like one of a kind we\ve got to reverse the broader trends he represents it\ time to rewrite the rules and make this economy fair for everyone and today i want to briefly share with you my plan for protecting taxpayers consumers small businesses and workers we\re going to crack down on the worst corporate abuses and empower companies willing to take the high road and invest in good jobs in higher wages and in stronger communities\n\nfirst let\ start with protecting taxpayers and making sure we have more fairness in the system it is wrong that corporations and the superwealthy play by a different set of rules a wall street money manager should not be able to pay a lower tax rate than a teacher or a nurse and i\ll tell you something else our largest companies should not be able to get away with paying hardly anything at all it is insulting when they engage in these games like moving their headquarters over to a foreign country  on paper not in reality  just to take advantage of lower tax rates and it is infuriating when they take tax breaks with one hand and give out pink slips in america with the other hand\n\nso here\ what we\re going to do we\re going to close those loopholes i\ve got a list of them we\re going after we\re going to make wall street corporations and the superrich start paying their fair share of taxes we\re going to pass something called the buffett rule which means multimillionaires cannot lower rates than their secretaries and other people working for them we\re going to put in place a new exit tax if companies try to leave our country to avoid paying their fair share if they try to outsource jobs they\re going to have to give back every tax break they ever received in our country and then we\re going to put that money to work creating opportunities here in america\n\nsecond we\re going to protect consumers no american should ever be taken advantage of like thousands were by wells fargo and this isn\t a new fight for me as a senator i raised the alarm about subprime mortgages i fought to hold reckless managers accountable for toxic toys and household products that threaten our kids i introduced legislation to protect americans\ personal data and combat identity theft so as president i will make consumer protection a top priority across the entire government\n\nand that starts by defending and empowering the consumer financial protection bureau which was created after the financial crisis and the principal person who got it created was senator elizabeth warren and under the leadership of ohio\ rich cordray the agency has already returned more than 11 billion to more than 15 million americans who were ripped off by predatory lenders credit card companies and others and it is the one making sure that the defrauded wells fargo customers get their money back\n\nnow i got to say i am so proud of what this new agency has done sometimes people say well what does the government really do well there\ a lot of examples but this is a primary one standing up and making sure consumers get paid back when they are ripped off and because of its success republicans in congress keep trying to shut it down and donald trump agrees with them in fact he wants to scrap all the tough new rules imposed on wall street after the crisis well not on my watch donald we\re never going to let that happen\n\nnow instead of gutting consumer protection we should be expanding it and we should build on the doddfrank financial reforms and go even further because wall street can never ever be permitted to threaten main street again and the wells fargo scandal sheds light on another threat to consumers that we have to address when the scam\ victims people like you and me who had accounts there tried to sue they were shocked to learn there was a provision in the very fine print of their contracts that kept them from going to court to sue the bank for being cheated instead they are forced into a closeddoor arbitration process without the important protections that you get in a court of law we are not going to let corporations like wells fargo use these fine print gotchas to escape accountability\n\nand in fact this is now common practice across a lot of industries  from nursing homes nursing homes that mistreat seniors to forprofit colleges that defraud students who reads all that fine print i don\t and you get defrauded or you get mistreated and then all of a sudden they say \well you can\t sue us\ so we\re going to rein in that abuse across everybody\n\nwe also see a similar problem in some international trade agreements like the transpacific partnership it sets up a dispute resolution system that favors large corporations over everyone else it\ one of the reasons i\m against it i\ve warned about this for years i\ve written about it and i oppose tpp now i will oppose it after the election i will oppose it as president  because it is onesided and unfair to american workers\n\nand what about all those pharmaceutical companies that jack up prices for no reason we\re going to have to protect ourselves against that too and when we find unjustified spikes in the prices of longstanding lifesaving drugs we should slap penalties on companies trying to cheat people who need those drugs\n\nand let\ finally import safe alternatives from other countries like canada and speed up approvals to get more generic drugs on the market and it is long past time to allow medicare to negotiate for better prices for drugs and get the cost down for medicare recipients and i believe we should cap the amount working families pay out of pocket every month for medicine no one should ever have to choose between paying the rent and filling their prescriptions\n\nso let\ stand up for taxpayers let\ stand up for consumers and let\ stand up for small businesses which create most of the jobs in america i take this personally because of my dad\ very small business we need fair rules of the road so big corporations can\t use their power to gain unfair advantages\n\nnow when it comes to bullying small businesses donald trump is the poster boy i have heard so many stories of contractors and i\ve met some too who worked for him produced the goods and services and never got paid for what they were owed i\m talking about painters and plumbers piano sellers architects glass installers  he stiffed them all not because he couldn\t pay them but he wouldn\t pay them and he told them \you want to get your money sue me\ my dad could never have done that i\m just grateful my dad never got a contract with donald trump because i don\t know what we would have done\n\nmore than 60 percent of small businesses face payment delays that can cause a serious cash flow crisis so as president i will explore new ways to arm small businesses with the tools to fight back and level the playing field part of the problem is large corporations are amassing so much power in our economy sometimes it\ called market concentration or even oldfashioned monopolies but either way it threatens businesses of all sizes as well as consumers with less competition corporations can use their power to raise prices limit choice for consumers cut wages for workers crowd out startups and small businesses\n\ni mean look what\ happening right now in most of the country the three largest health insurance companies in each state control 80 percent of the market no wonder premiums are going up as president i will appoint tough independent authorities to strengthen antitrust enforcement and really scrutinize mergers and acquisitions so the big don\t keep getting bigger and bigger\n\ni want every business to compete and thrive and then i also want to do something else let\ protect and empower workers who actually drive our economy everyone who works hard should be able to share in the rewards not just senior executives so we\re proposing new tax credits to encourage more companies to share profits on top of not instead of higher wages\n\nwe need to support new organizing strategies for employees who too often have never had the benefit of collective bargaining and we have to resist the assault on workers\ rights let\ say loudly and clearly \right to work\ is wrong for workers and wrong for america\n\nlet\ also my friends let\ raise the minimum wage and support the fight for 15 so you don\t live in poverty let\ defend overtime and go after wage theft let\ provide family leave that is paid and access to affordable highquality childcare and of course you know what i\m going to say let\ finally guarantee equal pay for women\n\nnow my opponent and his chief surrogates like to say i\m playing the woman\ card and i\ll tell you  right  if fighting for working families is playing the women\ card you know what deal me in!\n\nand then finally i\ve got a lot on my mind but finally we need to make it easier for companies to invest in good jobs here at home as president i will ramp up enforcement of trade rules by appointing a new chief trade prosecutor and tripling the number of enforcement officers we will work with both parties to pass the biggest investment in new goodpaying jobs since world war ii i want to direct 10 billion to create a \make it in america\ partnership to support american manufacturing and i want to take some of the ideas that worked when my husband was president and we ended up with 23 million new jobs and incomes went up for everybody\n\nthat includes incentives like the new markets tax credit for creating good jobs in poor or remote areas from inner cities to rural communities ravaged  ravaged  by hollowedout factories ravaged by mines that have been shut down ravaged by opiate addiction it all comes down to this when i say our economy should work for everyone not just those at the top i mean it and we\re going to do everything we can to make sure workers are treated like assets not costs and we\re going to bring back infrastructure jobs advanced manufacturing jobs clean renewable energy jobs innovation technology small business\n\nnow you don\t have to look any further than right here in northwest ohio just a few years ago as you heard kenyetta say in 2009 you were in the eye of the storm jobs homes savings wiped out the auto industry on the verge of collapse a lot of people were ready to give up on it well that would have meant giving up on 850000 people across this state whose jobs were tied to the industry donald trump for one said rescuing the auto industry didn\t matter very much either way would have been acceptable he said \we could have just let it go\ and that\ a direct quote from him everybody in ohio who\ thinking about voting for trump needs to hear that at the time of the worst financial crisis in ohio in 2009 he would have let you twist and fall and for his running mate he picked mike pence an ardent opponent of the auto rescue well thank goodness the people of northwest ohio weren\t ready to let it go you never gave up you didn\t lose faith and now after a lot of hard work and sacrifice the auto industry just had its best year ever\n\nbut that\ not all there is to the story because in addition to that hard work america america came to the rescue taxpayers like all of us not him but us provided the funds for the rescue union workers stepped up communities like toledo came together to make it work and now that the industry\ back on its feet the auto companies have a responsibility to give back\n\nso i was delighted to hear that chrysler is doubling down on toledo investing 700 million here to start building the next generation jeep wrangler which could create about 700 new good jobs and tens of thousands of uaw workers at chrysler plants should see a big increase in profitsharing payments above and beyond wages and benefits now that\ the way it\ supposed to work when we all help each other out when we stand together we are stronger together\n\nso what i want you to know is if you join me in this campaign i will always stand up and fight for you and fight for your jobs and fight for your families and i guess we have about 36 days left the election\ going to be close every call you make every door you knock every friend you register to vote could make the difference you can text \join\ join to 47246 right now or go to hillaryclintoncom to sign up and volunteer here in ohio you have until october the 11th to register to vote and there are people with clipboards around and you can go actually register today on your way out the door\n\nso we have just over a week to register and then early voting starts october 12th let\ prove  let\ prove  that the american dream is big enough for everyone to share in its promise let\ prove that we\re going to stand together make the smart decisions that we get the economy going and growing for everybody not just those at the top that we will stand up against special privilege and special interest that we will be ready after this election to have an agenda that will really make a difference here in toledo and across ohio so i\m here asking for your help asking for your work asking for you to be part of this campaign and then when we win on november 8 be part of changing our country for the better! thank you all and god bless you!
40,i am so excited to be here and i want to thank you and you know i am really sorry and i know there are a lot of people outdoors who can\t get inso i want to give a big shout out to the overflow outside i\m here with a lot of great people who are working so hard on this campaign i want to thank ken evans thank you so much ken i want to thank three members of congress congresswoman debbie wasserman schultz congressman alcee hastings and your congresswoman lois frankel i also want to thank sheriff israel for being here and mayor resnick just gave me a key to the city of wilton manors and i want to thank my longtime friend and such a great leader chad griffin human rights campaign president i know that chad told me there are a bunch of human rights campaign organizers and as i\ve said many times hrc for hrc sounds good to me\nwell my friends just nine days left until november the 8th nine days that really will determine the outcome of the most important election of our lifetimes and we cannot take anyone or anything for granted it\ great to be here at the manor complex a place that means so much to so many and there have been ups and downs in all that we\ve gone through over the years and even in this campaign but i want you to know i am focused on one thing you  your lives your futures the problems that keep you up at night that\ what i\m interested in and that\ what i\m going to be talking about here today and throughout the next nine days\n\nthat\ really what this election is about there\ a lot of noise and distraction but it really comes down to what kind of future we want and who as our president can help us get there so i want you to know  now i just have to say i know i\m preaching to the choir but i also through you want to talk to people who are still making up their minds believe it or not right because we\ve got a choice between a president who will bring us together keep our country safe get the economy working for everyone not just those at the top  or someone who\ temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified for the job you know donald trump is doing his best to confuse mislead and discourage the american people i mean he\ such a downer right and it\ time for him to stop fear mongering stop distracting from what\ really at stake and frankly stop disgracing our democracy we can\t let him get away with this\n\nbut here\ the good news yes america is great and we can make it greater if we work together and we set some goals but we are seeing americans coming together  democrats republicans independents  to reject donald trump\ dark and divisive vision of our country and it\ going to be really important that we make it clear to everyone in these last nine days what\ at stake because i really believe the vast majority of americans agree with us we don\t want a president who demeans women we don\t want a president who has plans to break up and deport immigrant families we don\t want a president who perpetrated the lie that president obama wasn\t born in america we don\t want a president who would appoint supreme court justices to overturn marriage equality but i want you to know the energy we\re now seeing out in the campaign is not just about what we\re against it\ also about what we\re for because we also share a common vision beyond partisanship and politics it\ a hopeful inclusive america where everyone counts and everyone has a place right\n\nand that\ exactly what i\m going to be fighting for in these last nine days we\re going to honor people not insult them donald trump has insulted more than half of our population african americans latinos immigrants muslims pows women and by what he has said so many others who believe that you have a positive future i agree with that you do and i promise you this i\m going to keep working every single day for you and for the vision of america that we share\n\nnow i will tell you my mom taught me to never ever quit and what does that mean well that means \n\nyou got it you got it and it also means when you\re knocked down what matters is whether you get up again i have been fighting for families and underdogs my entire life i\m not stopping now we\re just getting warmed up right and we won\t be distracted no matter what our opponents throw at us we\re not going to be knocked off course we know how much this election matters and we know how many people are counting on us so we\re going to take to heart the words of our wonderful first lady michelle obama when they go low we go high\n\nwe\re going to keep our foot on the gas because donald trump\ strategy is real simple they\ve even said it in his campaign here\ his strategy about how he\ going to win get women to stay home get young people to stay home get people of color to stay home get the lgbt committee to say home it\ all part of his scorched earth campaign and it goes against everything we stand for so you know how we\re going to stop him by showing up with the biggest turnout in american history\n\nwe need everybody to turn out and vote  women young people people of color the lgbt community latinos african americans americans from all walks of life let\ break every single record let\ make that the story of this election and here\ some really good news this is amazing more than 20 million people have already voted in this election most of those votes in the last few days 3 million of those votes from right here in florida now you only see numbers like that when people are standing up for what they really believe in so if all of you vote if your friends your family your coworkers vote if everyone you talk to between now and election day votes we are going to make some really big history on november the 8th\n\nand i want you not only coming out for me i want you to reelect our members of congress and please elect patrick murphy to the senate and if there are still people who have doubts about the stakes in the election listen to this we\ve heard some outrageous things in this campaign i\m sure we\ll hear more in the next nine days but i got to tell you i was beginning to think that nothing we learned about donald trump could surprise me anymore\n\nbut yesterday the washington post published a report that was truly stunning it starts with the story of a ribboncutting back in 1996 for a nursery school serving children living with hiv and aids in new york now let me say this is important in part to remember this is a story about children with hiv and aids so there was a big celebration honoring the donors who had supported the nursery school and all the kids and their families for whom this was the most important thing you can imagine because you know back in the \90s some of you remember right children weren\t welcomed in school\n\nand then unannounced and uninvited guess who barges in donald trump he walks right up to the stage he sat down in the seat that was being saved for a local developer who had made a generous donation none of the people working for the charity knew why he was there he wasn\t a donor at all he had never given a single dollar to help build the school he just wanted people to think he had so he sat on the stage through the program even posed for photographs and when it was over he got up and walked out no explanation no donation now really who does that what kind of person does that really i mean who pretends to help kids with hiv and aids in order to make themselves look good well i\ll tell you the same kind of person who would pull a bait and switch on a high school chess team\n\nback in 1997 he was principal for a day at a public school that was a program we used to have in new york the chess team was holding a bake sale to raise money to travel to a tournament they were 5000 short he walked up to them and handed them a fake million dollar bill at first the kids and their parents were excited then they were devastated to learn it was a joke so he gave them 200 bucks and drove away in his limousine now this story does have a happy ending because a woman read the story about donald trump\ behavior called the school and donated the 5000 and the coach remembers this woman saying i am ashamed to be the same species as this man\n\nnow i got to say any of you see the debates well you know i stood next to donald trump in three debates for four and a half hours proving conclusively i have the stamina to do this job right but a lot of what we\ve heard him say is part of a lifelong pattern and here\ what the washington post concludes \for as long as he has been rich and famous he has wanted people to believe he is generous he spent years constructing an image as a philanthropist by appearing at charity events and by making very public even nationally televised promises to give his own money away it was in large part a facade and a monthslong investigation by the washington post found that trump had sought credit for charity he had not given or had claimed other people\ giving as his own\n\nnow of course because he\ refused to release his tax returns we don\t even know if he\ ever given anything but here\ what we do know with donald it\ always donald trump first and everyone else last he abuses his power he games the system and he doesn\t care who\ left holding the bag\n\nand here\ what else we know donald trump has a terrible record on lgbt rights and this election will determine whether we continue the progress we\ve made or let it be ripped away we know trump has promised he\ll appoint supreme court justices who will overturn marriage equality and that he will repeal president obama\ executive actions to protect lgbt people from discrimination and just this week a new story came out that tells us a lot about how he treats lgbt employees it\ a story of a maintenance worker at one of trump\ golf courses so i want you just to think\n\nthis guy works hard works with his hands probably there 12 hours a day maybe more when it\ the summer season after he told his coworkers he was gay they started harassing him they called him names they even threw rocks and golf balls at him it got so bad he ended up in the hospital now his supervisor saw all of this and did nothing so finally he went to the police for help he was too scared even to come back to work and what did the trump golf course do they fired him\n\nnow this is a heartwrenching story on a lot of levels for starters it\ a painful reminder of the harassment violence and discrimination too many lgbt americans still face every single day and it\ deeply distributing that instead of stepping in to stop this unacceptable behavior trump\ business punished the victim for coming forward now if that\ how donald trump runs his business what does it say about how he would run our country we\ve made a lot of progress on lgbt rights but as that story reminds us we still have work ahead don\t we\n\nthere is still no federal law that stops an employer from refusing to hire someone just because he or she is lgbt or a landlord from refusing to rent an apartment to a transgender tenant and of course there are still states where you could get married on saturday post your facebook photos on sunday and get fired on monday just because of who you are and who you love so here\ what i\ll do as president we will call on the congress to pass the equality act and we will then be able to protect lgbt americans from discrimination in all aspects of our lives we\ll work together to achieve the aidsfree generation that is within our reach and we will take on homelessness bullying and violence particularly youth homelessness which disproportionately hurts lgbt kids and we are going to end the harmful practice of socalled conversion therapy lgbt kids don\t need to be cured of anything they just need to be accepted and embraced and respected and yes we\re going to bring people together to reform our gun laws and keep guns from falling into the wrong hands so that what happened in orlando can never happen again\n\nnow some of you know chad griffin and others know this issue is really important to me i traveled to 112 countries as your secretary of state i saw how countries around the world treated lesbian gay bisexual and transgender people and i believe with all my heart america has to lead by example i want  i want lgbt people in every corner of our country  because don\t forget you all living in wilton manors have moved far away from a lot of the places where people are still scared today right and we\re going to elevate this issue we\re going to talk about it we\re going to reach out\n\nso when you vote in this election remember it\ not just my name on the ballot it\ your future it\ who we are as a country it\ every issue we care about and make no mistake lgbt rights are at stake dignity and respect for every american is at stake the future of our economy is at stake\n\ni believe when the middle class thrives americans thrive and we\re going to make america the cleanenergy superpower of the 21st century too and if we\re serious about supporting a middle class we\re going to be supporting families\n\nthe other day i was in pittsburgh and there was a woman there with her young child we\ve got some folks from pittsburgh she was shaking tim kaine\ hand and she said to him i came here hoping i could tell you or secretary clinton i had my baby three years ago and the next day i was fired it had been a difficult pregnancy i called to ask if i could take a little time to recover and the answer was \no don\t come back at all\ nobody no parent should ever have to make that kind of choice but that\ also true when we talk about paid family leave caring for a spouse or a partner caring for an elderly relative\n\ni want us to recognize the way we live today it is no longer the 1950s we need to support people who are part of committed relationships of families of marriages and give everybody the support you need to actually do what\ the most important thing in life and that is caring for each other we\re going to do everything we can to catch up to the rest of

thought to myself how smart do you have to be to lose a billion dollars i mean really and what kind of genius are you to lose a billion dollars while running casinos but it\ serious because it means he\ paid zero zero for our military our vets for healthcare for pell grants for our universities our colleges our highways this is trump to a t\n\nthe stories that i told you about him showing up and acting like he\ done something well he shows up and criticizes our country he shows up and discriminates against african americans when he was denying them the right to rent apartments he chose to

41,hello winstonsalem! hello wake forest! it is so great to be here in this beautiful city at this extraordinary time and to have a chance to be with so many including the wake forest family and it doesn\t get any better than being here with our most amazing first lady michelle obama i want to thank everyone who has filled this arena and i especially want to thank dr hatch and the staff team and students at wake forest university i will never forget being here with the legendary maya angelou one of the most powerful voices our country has ever heard\nso i couldn\t think of a better place to come back to with another woman whose voice we need now more than ever i want to say what i think is obvious but can\t be said enough and that is this may be one of the most if not the most important election of our lifetimes no matter our age but for young people it will be so consequential because every election is about the future and this one is about whether we build on the progress we\ve made the legacy that president obama has built or rip it away and go backwards so we have a lot of work to do\n\nand i don\t mean just in the presidential race let\ be sure to elect roy cooper the next governor of north carolina he will always put the people of north carolina first and he will repeal hb2  because he knows that discrimination is wrong it\ bad for business and it\ against north carolina\ values\n\nand let\ send deborah ross to the united states senate she will be an independent voice for the working families in this state and she will help break through the gridlock in washington\n\nand unlike her opponent deborah ross has never been afraid to stand up to donald trump and remember it is not just roy\ name and deborah\ name or my name that\ going to be on the ballot so much of what we care about  so much that\ at stake in the election is too\n\nvoting rights are at stake and if you care about this sacred right and want to make sure our leaders of both parties do their part to protect and strengthen it  not chip away at it you\ve got to vote in this election and so i hope after all north carolina has gone through with the efforts to suppress people\ votes you will turn out and say no we demand the right to vote\n\nand supporting our veterans is at stake if you believe that america should stand with those who served because they served us then you\ve got to vote and so when you think about yourselves your families people you know who\ve worn the uniform of our country the best way to make clear that we respect the military and we will do everything we can to make sure they and their families have what they need as they sacrificed for us is to show up and vote\n\nand climate change is at stake now i shouldn\t have to say this in 2016 but i will if you believe in science right and you know that climate change is real and demands action right now  you\ve got to show up and vote in this election\n\nimmigration is at stake if you believe that we need to fix our broken system keep families together and give people who love america a path to citizenship  you\ve got to vote\n\nand marriage equality is at stake too if you believe everyone deserves to be treated equally in america no matter who they are or who they love  then you\ve got to turn out and vote in this election\n\ngood jobs that pay good wages are at stake investing in our roads and our bridges and our water systems and all the work that needs to be done in our country that really matters and we can put millions of people to work and have a more competitive economy that\ why we\ve proposed a very big jobs program because i don\t want anybody willing to work in this country not to have a good job with a rising income to support themselves and their families if you believe that then you\ve got to come out and vote\n\nand particularly for all of the students here affordable college education is at stake and not only that relief from student debt that you already have is at stake so if you believe as we do that everyone should be able to afford to go to college and graduate and that everyone should be able to pay down and pay off their debt then you\ve got to get out and vote in this election\n\nand dignity for women and girls again i wish i didn\t have to say this right but indeed dignity and respect for women and girls is also on the ballot in this election and i want to thank our first lady for her eloquent powerful defense of that basic value so i think you\re getting the idea here that i think everything we care about is at stake in this election so you\ve got to vote  and get your friends and families and neighbors to vote too\n\nand don\t just take it from me because i think you\ve heard some really compelling voices say the same thing and one of them is here with us today right there are so many things i admire about our first lady michelle reminds us to work hard stay true to our values be good to one another and never ever stop fighting for what we believe in\n\nshe has spent eight years as our first lady advocating for girls around the world to go to school and have the same opportunities as boys she has worked for healthier childhoods for our kids here at home better nutrition more exercise and we are seeing the results we actually are seeing kids who are healthier something that she was determined to try to achieve she has encouraged more young people to go to college and follow your dreams and she has supported america\ military families who serve and sacrifice as well for our country\n\nnow it hasn\t been all hard work she played a mean round of \carpool karaoke\ and among the many real privileges i\ve had is to see the president and the first lady dance wow one could only hope now she also planted an amazing vegetable garden at the white house  and i can promise you if i win i will take good care of it michelle\n\nand boy  thank you! boy didn\t she dazzle the world with that wise and beautiful speech at the democratic national convention this summer\n\nand i have now i have now stood on the debate stage for four and a half hours with donald trump and if you see any of those debates well that has proved once and for all that i have the stamina to be president and commander in chief but there were times during those three debates the loop running in my head was what michelle said at the convention right \when they go low we go high\\n\nand on top of all that just by being herself every day never missing an opportunity to honor her parents for the hard work and sacrifice that set her on her way she has shown every little girl and boy in america that there are no limits to what they can achieve if they work hard and do right and believe in themselves\n\nseriously  is there anyone more inspiring than michelle obama\n\nand maybe maybe it\ especially meaningful to me because i do know something about being first lady of the united states and i\m going to state the obvious it\ not easy you\ve got so many people counting on you you\ve got the eyes of the world on you and when you\re trying to raise your children as she is and i did and give them the space and support they need to have as normal and safe and fulfilling childhoods as possible  that makes it even harder i used to hang out in the main hall on the second floor of the white house around the time chelsea would come home from school just to be sure i got to see her and see what happened that day and try to figure out what i needed to be thinking about and doing for her\n\nand let\ be real  as our first africanamerican first lady she\ faced pressures i never did and she\ handled them with pure grace by any standard she has been an outstanding first lady who has made us all so proud\n\nand she and the president she and the president have been such wonderful friends to me and my family it has just meant the world the world to me it really has\n\ni want to say just one thing about the first lady\ work i mentioned military families she\ been their fierce champion and military families have come up against a lot in this election it just made me boil when donald trump disrespected a gold star family mr and mrs khan he still hasn\t apologized to them\n\nhe actually made it worse  just yesterday he said again that if america had only made him president years ago their son captain khan would still be alive honestly i don\t  i don\t understand how anyone would want to rub salt in the wounds of a grieving family\n\nand he keeps insulting our military yesterday when he heard that a retired army colonel and former dean of the army war college said that donald doesn\t understand military strategy trump said \i\ll teach him a couple things\ well actually donald you\re the one who\ got a lot to learn about the military and everything else that makes america great starting by learning about the dignity and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform and their families and he should learn from michelle obama how a leader supports them not disrespects them!\n\nno one knows the stakes in this election better than our first lady because all the progress that we\ve achieved under president obama\ leadership is at stake  he pulled our economy out of the biggest ditch that it was in when he became president he saved the auto industry he cracked down on wall street he has tackled healthcare climate change civil rights and so much else\n\nand all the work that we\ve done to strengthen our relationships with other countries and secure our leadership in the world is also at stake\n\nnow i for one and i hope all of you do not want all that hard work  by our president and our first lady and by millions of americans  to be wiped away we cannot let that happen\n\nwe\ve got to do everything in our power to get everyone out to vote to understand no matter what issue you care about it truly is on the ballot now this has been a hard election at times it\ gotten pretty ugly hasn\t it we\ve all felt it  especially our kids\n\ni hear this from parents and children across our country  kids write me notes they hand me little cards and notes when i shake hands with them their parents write to me teachers talk to me kids are scared kids are scared by the rhetoric they\re hearing right i see the educators\ heads nodding\n\nlittle girls hear the ugly things that have been said about women in this campaign and it makes them feel terrible and doubt themselves  and that is why it is important for voices like our first lady\ to stand up and say \wait a minute respecting women and girls is so important\ and it is especially important for us to send that message to our children boys and girls alike\n\nour kids are scared that they\re going to be sent out of the country because their parents are immigrants or they\re immigrants they\re scared if they\re muslim or have a disability i got a letter from a parent  a mom from wisconsin i think who adopted her son felix from ethiopia when he was a toddler he just turned 11 years old  he wrote my campaign to let me know he was now 11 years old i love it when little kids do little birthday remembrances america is the only country he\ ever known one day he turned to his mom and asked \if donald trump becomes president is he going to make me go back to ethiopia\\n\nnow that honestly breaks my heart we\ve got to make sure all our kids know that america has a place for you  the american dream is big enough for you and then we\ve got to make sure they learn the right lessons about how to treat people i saw that sign i believe in love and kindness right\n\nwell here\ one place to start we know that bullying is a real problem in our classrooms our playgrounds and online  and teachers have reported that this election has made it worse so i want you to know we\re going to launch a major new effort to help states and communities and schools and families end bullying wherever it takes places and we will work together to make the internet a safer space for kids invest in frontline professionals like guidance counselors and social workers and school nurses and psychologists to support kids who\ve been targeted like the young woman i met in iowa who told me she was bullied because of her asthma this has got to stop and i can\t think of anything more important than making sure every single one of our kids knows that they loved just as they are\n\nso ultimately my friends as michelle reminded us this election is about our kids and in my case my grandkids their lives and their futures  nothing is more important to me than that i\ve been fighting for kids throughout my career i will fight for them every single day of my presidency so we have a job to do\n\nstarting right now let\ come together let\ work together and let\ be hopeful and optimistic and unified in the face of division and hate bring people together in a spirit of mutual respect to solve shared challenges let\ have each other\ backs lift each other up not tear each other down\n\nlet\ go out and win this election to make sure we do exactly that  for roy cooper deborah ross and all of us let\ make sure you vote early vote as soon as you can vote this afternoon i\m excited about what we\re going to see happen here in north carolina and i am so excited to be introducing our amazing first lady michelle obama!
42,thank you so much wow it is great to be here\nand thank you i am so honored to be introduced by mae wiggins and someone who made such a contribution throughout her life as a nurse to so many people and who as you can tell just feels still the pain of being rejected on the basis of her race\n\nit took a lot of courage to come here mae thank you thank you for being with us\n\ni also want to thank a longtime friend of mine a great activist extraordinary advocate in congress and that\ us representative eleanor holmes norton i want to thank mayor allen thomas for welcoming me here and either you\re all related to him or you think he\ doing a good job\n\nwell i told him i want to be a good partner with mayors like him and work to help communities like greenville that are growing and striving and attracting young people he told me that the average age in the residents here in greenville was 26 years old\n\ni also want to acknowledge josh stein candidate for north carolina attorney general patsy keever chair of the north carolina democratic party and state senator don davis\n\nand i saved the best for last someone who i\ve gotten to know over the years someone who i really look forward to working with first thing that congressman butterfield said to me is i have to talk to you about our farmers very first thing he said proceeded to tell me that he was out on a 200acre sweet potato farm earlier today we talked about the damage that hurricane matthew has done the lives lost the homes lost and also the agricultural damage with all the flooding and my heart goes out to everyone who has been affected we\ve got to be really focused on what we\re going to do with this extreme weather we\re getting more of it in more places and i\m going to make that a priority for my presidency to make sure communities are well prepared they\re resilient but that we also work to try to limit the damage by taking on the challenge of climate change and changing weather patterns\n\nand nobody knows more about weather than our farmers and i am very committed to supporting farms of all sizes but particularly small farms you know i think you said the farm you went to this morning gk was 200 acres you know that\ a lot of land but that\ not a gigantic multithousandacre farm and sometimes i think that we spend too much time and money looking after the big giant farms and not enough taking care of the smaller farms the familyowned farms farms that have been in people\ families for generations\n\nand i will do my very best working with gk and eleanor and others in congress to focus federal attention and resources on places that need it and eastern north carolina is a place that needs it there are still too many people who feel like they have been left out and left behind and so we\ve got to spend time thinking about how we bring everybody along\n\nthat is my goal as your president i want to knock down the barriers that stand in the way of people and places getting ahead now also on a personal note i was in arizona last night and had a great rally there i don\t know  15000 16000 people it was just extraordinary but i was a little anxious during my speech because the cubs were playing in the world series\n\nand you know i\ve been a fan all my life started watching baseball with my dad went to wrigley field and you know it\ been a long time 108 years to win a championship and make history and i only wish that my late father and the great ernie banks mr cub could have seen it happen so last night was very special on lots of fronts and who knows maybe we\ll see even more history made in a few days you know the last time the cubs won women couldn\t vote and i think women are making up for that in this election\n\nso thank you thank you so much for being here are you ready to vote how many  how many folks have already voted \n\nwell that\ really impressive are you ready to volunteer these last few days are you ready to elect ray cooper your governor have a governor who puts families first and your needs i know he\ll do a terrific job\n\nare you ready to elect deborah ross to the united states senate she will be the independent voice that north carolina families deserve and unlike her opponent she\ never been afraid to stand up to donald trump and then are you ready to elect our next president and commander in chief\n\nyou know did any of you  any of you see those debates well you know i spent fourandahalf hours standing next to donald trump proving conclusively i have the stamina to be the next president and commander in chief\n\nbut you know he kept saying things like well you know what have you done for 30 years well we know what he\ done for 30 years starting with discriminating against african americans and denying them housing back in the 1970s\n\ni chose a different path i have spent my career fighting for kids and families and i helped to create the children\ health insurance program as first lady that now provides healthcare to 8 million children a year and i have to tell you i know it doesn\t make headlines it\ not going to you know get a big twitter war going but when i travel around and shake hands like i\ll do after my remarks and somebody says to me the children\ health insurance program saved my son\ life i met a woman here in north carolina whose daughter was born deaf and the doctor said you know she\ never ever going to be able to talk she\ not ever going to be able to hear her mother who is determined began doing investigations she found out that there were some possible treatments but they were expensive she didn\t know what she was going to do and she took her daughter to the doctor and the doctor said i just heard about this new program the children\ health insurance program maybe you can qualify for that\n\nbecause it\ really for families that aren\t poor but don\t have much money and a lot of families isn\t it and families that don\t have an employer that provides health insurance self employed independent contractors\n\nso the mom found out about this thing call the children\ health program and low and behold they did qualify and they started the treatments for their daughter i met that young woman and she said hello to me and she talked to me she just graduated from college right here in north carolina so don\t let anybody tell you it doesn\t matter what you stand for what you fight for and who you are trying to help when you make your decision about who to vote for in this election\n\nas a senator from new york i worked to rebuild new york city after the 9/11 attacks and to provide healthcare to the brave first responders who ran toward danger not away from it and many of them\n\n \n\n where you there god bless you that\ another thing i meet people all over who were there and who worked there and i meet people who got sick because they worked there and as your secretary of state i traveled to 112 countries negotiated cease fires reduced the threat of nuclear weapons stood up for human rights and women\ right and lgbt rights around the world\n\nand everything i\ve done it\ because i\ve been listening to people and again i know that\ not very exciting i plead to that you spend time listening not talking you know what are the poor journalists going to say uh there hillary clinton was listening again right\n\nbut i\ll tell you it is what motivates me to hear people\ stories to hear the tribulations and triumphs you get good ideas bring people together find common ground even with people we disagree with i disagree with people on lots of issues but i believe the only way we can get things done is to actually listen and respect each other and try to find common that common ground and that will enable us to get results for people and if you elect me next tuesday that is the kind of president i\ll be\n\nand from the first day of this campaign i\ve been telling you what i want to do putting forth my ideas about what i think will help you i truly believe that you deserve a candidate that you can vote for not just someone to vote against and so if we are gonna make this choice we have got to be clear the positives and the negatives because one way or the other come this january america is going to have a new president and it will be either me or donald trump\n\nand you know what else people say all the time you know i want change will come that is certain the question is what kind of change are we going to have are we going to work together to build a stronger fairer better america or are we going to fear the future and fear each other and hunker down and be paralyzed by all of our prejudices our discrimination that stops us from coming together so here is what i want you to do in these next days as you talk with people who maybe haven\t yet voted maybe haven\t yet made up their mind i want you to ask them imagine it is january 20th 2017 and it is donald trump standing in front of the capital taking the oath of office\n\nimagine what that will be like to have him in the oval office making the decisions that effect your lives and your futures imagine having a president who demeans women mocks the disabled insults african americans and latinos who pits people against each other instead of pulling them together someone who always puts himself first and doesn\t care who gets hurt along the way\n\na president with a very thin skin who lashes out at anyone who challenges him who praises adversaries like vladimir putin and picks fights with our allies and even attacked the pope the truth is we don\t have to imagine what that would be like because everything that donald trump has said and done both in his career and in his campaign is a preview of what could happen\n\nyou know as michelle obama says the presidency doesn\t change who you are it reveals who you are and we have all see all we need of donald trump if donald trump were to win this election we would have a commander and chief who is completely out of his depth and whose ideas are incredibly dangerous someone who wants more countries to have nuclear weapons and who could easily insult a foreign leader and start a real war instead of just a twitter war and yet this morning in florida donald stood on a stage and said and i quote i am honored to have the greatest temperament that anyone has ever had now  he knows we can see and hear him right\n\nthis is someone who at another rally yesterday actually said out loud to himself stay on point donald stay on point his campaign probably put that in the teleprompters stay on point donald stay on point you know we have seen it over and over again we know his true self his instinct is to say whatever pops into his head no matter how wrong he is he can\t help himself so is this someone we want to put in charge of our military\n\nis this someone that we want to treat people the way he has demonstrated his disrespect throughout this campaign in a country that values religious liberty and freedom someone who would ban every muslim in the world from ever coming to our country someone who thinks the lives of black people are all crime and poverty and despair he has no idea none about the strength of the black church the vibrancy of black owned businesses the excellence of historically black colleges and universities the rise of a new generation of black activists for social justice and the success of black leaders in every field remember how he denied housing to mae brown wiggins and mae wasn\t alone whenever african americans tried to rent an apartment their application was marked with a c  c for colored\n\nin fact donald his father fred and their entire company were sued by the justice department for discriminating against african americans and latinos in the 1970s they settled the case but the justice department was forced to go after them again because they continued to discriminate against people of color think about that if he were to win he would be in charge of the federal housing department if he doesn\t respect all americans how can we trust him to serve all americans\n\nand then another recent example is the way donald trump treated what are called the central park five these were five black and latino kids some as young as 14 who it turns out were wrongly convicted of a terrible crime in new york back in 1990\n\ndonald trump took out fullpage ads in four newspapers calling for the death penalty for these kids nearly three decades later they were exonerated by dna evidence also someone else confessed to the crime so they were finally released from prison and justice was done but not only did donald trump refuse to apologize for calling for their execution he actually said they should still be in prison\n\nto him those kids will still and always be guilty no matter what the evidence says do we want this man appointing judges do we want him controlling the justice department\n\n no!\n\n well people who are voting for him that\ what they would get he has spent this entire campaign offering a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters he retweets white supremacists and spreads racially tinged conspiracy theories and you better believe he\ being heard loudly and clearly\n\njust a few days ago and i want you to hear this because this has never happened to a major  to a nominee of a major party just a few days ago donald trump was endorsed by the official newspaper of the ku klux klan\n\nthey wrote their endorsement under the slogan of his campaign make america great again they said it\ about preserving white identity and they placed their faith and hope in him you\ve got to ask yourself do any of us  any of us who believe in our constitution who believe in the rule of law who believe that we are stronger together who believe that we want to keep moving positively toward the vision of freedom and equality set forth by our founders  do any of us have a place in trump\ america\n\nit\ not just about communities of color it\ about young people it\ about any of us who don\t ever want us to go back to a time when you could officially discriminate where people could be intimidated that is not who america is and we\re not going to let it ever go back to that\n\nbut it doesn\t end there you\ve also got to ask do women and girls have a place either imagine our daughters or in my case now my granddaughter growing up with someone who ranks women by their looks gives them numbers and brags about doing things to them without their consent just imagine what that would mean to young women\ confidence and selfworth and how that will affect our young men and boys who we want to teach and nurture also to respect each other and respect girls and women as well\n\nso this is a pretty clear choice north carolina i\ve said many times in this campaign that donald trump has showed us who he is now we have to decide who we are right\n\nand across america people are doing just that  rejecting trump\ dark and divisive vision for one that is much more hopeful inclusive and unifying we know that america is bighearted not smallminded we want to lift people up not tear people down\n\nwe are called  we are called in fact we are commanded those of us who are christians to love our neighbor as ourselves aren\t we we are not asked we are not requested we are not urged  we are commanded and we know how hard that is when i used to teach sunday school i often taught on that not because it was well known but because i think it\ so hard and challenging\n\nlove your neighbor as yourself well first you\ve got to love yourself you\ve got to respect yourself and then you have to love your neighbor as yourself i believe with all my heart that we are better than this and that\ why i want to paint a different picture because here\ what we\re going to do if we win this election we\re going to take on systemic racism with a full commitment and real follow through\n\nwe are not going to accept the status quo what happened to that church in mississippi yesterday should not be normal people painted vote trump on the side and then they set it on fire who would do that to a house of worship in america that can never be acceptable what happened in flint michigan should not be normal or acceptable  little babies toddlers children drinking water that was poisoning them and there are too many young african americans who are dying either in police incidents or from random gun violence you know their names trayvon martin eric garner sander bland key scott so many we can\t accept that as normal either\n\nso we are going to get to work i\m just telling you if i\m fortunate enough to be your president we\re going to roll up our sleeves and get to work because that\ when we\re at our best solving our problems\n\nwe\re going to dismantle the socalled schooltoprison pipeline and replace it with a cradletocareer pipeline for every child in this country i want to make sure that our kids have the chance to thrive with good schools and good teachers no matter what zip code they live in\n\nwe will reform our criminal justice system from end to end it is wrong and i don\t care whether you are black or white it is wrong that black men are far more likely to be stopped by police charged and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men for the same crimes it\ wrong and we\re going to do something about that and donald trump whenever he\ face with these issues says well the answer to our problems is more law and order he doesn\t tell you what he means by that but it\ kind of code for fear and division what i think we need to do is to work together to restore trust between our police and our communities\n\ni think we are all safer when everyone has respect for the law and everyone is respected by the law and it\ not all we are going to take common sense steps to reduce gun violence and save lives because right now we\ve got too many people who should not have excess to weapons the mentally ill felons domestic abusers terrorists you know we can\t just bow down and say theres nothing we can do commensurate with the second amendment donald\ always trying to say oh you know she\ going to repeal the second amendment what nonsense absolute nonsense but i believe we can respect and honor the second amendment and keep people safer by keeping guns out of the wrong hands\n\nand we\re going to make significant investments in communities that have been let down and left behind congressman butterfield and i were talking about this there\ some good ideas in the congress to focus on communities white black latino native american wherever they might be that have been left out we need to get the engine of economic growth going because we believe that we should have an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top we believe that we should raise the national minimum wage because anyone who works full time in poverty should not be mired and left behind and i think not only do americans deserve a raise which donald doesn\t agree with and wanted to eliminate the national minimum wage i think it\ finally time for women to get equal pay for the work we do\n\ni don\t know about you but this is not just a women\ issue i\m always accused by donald and his supporters that whenever i talk like that i\m playing the woman\ card well i\ve always said if that\ playing the woman\ card deal me in you got that right\n\nbut i actually think i\m playing the family economics card because if you have a mother a wife a sister or a daughter she deserves to be paid fairly for what she does in the work force\n\nand we\re going to have a big investments in new jobs infrastructure jobs our roads our bridges our tunnels our ports our airports our water systems and we\re going to do more to bring advanced manufacturing to inner cities and rural communities put people to work doing work that has a really productive purpose we\re going to invest in more clean renewable energy jobs these are jobs that cannot be exported they have to be done right here in eastern north carolina\n\nnow it\ fair to say ok that sounds good how are you going to do all that ok i\ll tell you two things first i have said and you can hold me to it i will not  will not raise taxes on anyone making less than 25000 a year you see i come from the middle class my dad never made anything near that even in those dollars back in those days but i know that the best way to grow our economy is from the middle out and the bottom up not the top down that does not work for most americans and so secondly i\m going where the money is the money has gone to the wealthiest of americans and big corporations in the last 15 years and if you ask donald trump what is his economic policy it is to give trillions  trillions of dollars in tax cuts to himself to his family to the wealthy to corporations i just think that\ a bad bad idea\n\nwe\re going to make the wealthy pay their fair share and we\re going to make sure wall street never threatens main street again and we\re going to make public colleges like east carolina university tuitionfree tuitionfree for working and middle class families and debt free for everybody else and if you\re struggling with student debt we have a plan to ease that burden and cut your bills and get you out from under debt and we\re going to create 25 billion fund specifically aimed at supporting historically black colleges and universities\n\nbut i don\t think that every young person needs to go college if you want to i\m going to make it affordable for you but if you also want some other way of making a good living let\ bring technical education back into high schools and connect them up with community colleges and business apprenticeships\n\nthere is such a stark difference on every issue that matters between me and my opponent and i\m asking folks who are still making up their minds to really search your heart about what kind of country we are and what kind of future we want i just don\t believe we\re at our best when we stoke fear about each other now that does not mean we have to agree about everything of course not but it does mean we have to be willing to listen and to come together to solve problems that affect us individually and as a society\n\ni don\t think i have all the answers i don\t think anybody does when donald trump at his conventions said he alone could fix everything in america i thought about our founders meeting in philadelphia it wasn\t one person creating our country it was many people working together think about every social movement every economic advance every university like this one every achievement that you\ve made in your own life somebody helped you you worked with somebody look at this community everybody working together making greenville really grow and thrive making this university better and better every single year that is my experience of america so here\ what i hope you will do i hope you will get everybody you know and yourselves  if you haven\t voted yet to vote early because the other\ strategy is to scare people and intimidate people from going to the polls now donald trump\ campaign knows that if women turn out if people of color turn out if young people turn out if people who share our vision of a positive unified country turnout there\ no way he can win because that is more than half the people in america\n\nyou may have noticed that president obama was in chapel hill yesterday he\ coming back to north carolina tomorrow because he know how hard it is to get anything done in washington as he said yesterday everything we\ve done is dependent on him being to pass the baton to somebody who believes in the same things he does well i\ll tell you what i\m ready to grab that baton he\ going to have to bend down for me to be able to reach it because you know he\ a tall man but i\ve been practicing i spent four years working with him i call him my partner and my friend and i am ready to defend and build on his progress coming out of his eight years of the presidency\n\nso let\ get out and vote and let\ vote for the kind of future that we want the kind of country that we want find your early voting location for the next three days please go take people there we will show once and for all love trumps hate thank you all
