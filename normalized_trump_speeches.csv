0,thank you lester our jobs are fleeing the country theyre going to mexico theyre going to many other countries you look at what china is doing to our country in terms of making our product theyre devaluing their currency and there nobody in our government to fight them and we have a very good fight and we have a winning fight because theyre using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild china and many other countries are doing the same thing so were losing our good jobs so many of them when you look at what happening in mexico a friend of mine who builds plants said it the eighth wonder of the world theyre building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world some of the most sophisticated some of the best plants with the united states as he said not so much so ford is leaving you see that their small car division leaving thousands of jobs leaving michigan leaving ohio theyre all leaving and we cant allow it to happen anymore as far as child care is concerned and so many other things i think hillary and i agree on that we probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what were going to do but perhaps well be talking about that later but we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us we have to stop our companies from leaving the united states and with it firing all of their people all you have to do is take a look at carrier air conditioning in indianapolis they left  fired 1400 people theyre going to mexico so many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this we cannot let it happen under my plan ill be reducing taxes tremendously from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies small and big businesses that going to be a job creator like we havent seen since ronald reagan it going to be a beautiful thing to watch companies will come they will build they will expand new companies will start and i look very very much forward to doing it we have to renegotiate our trade deals and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs well for one thing  and before we start on that  my father gave me a very small loan in 1975 and i built it into a company that worth many many billions of dollars with some of the greatest assets in the world and i say that only because that the kind of thinking that our country needs our country in deep trouble we dont know what were doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world especially china theyre the best the best ever at it what theyre doing to us is a very very sad thing so we have to do that we have to renegotiate our trade deals and lester theyre taking our jobs theyre giving incentives theyre doing things that frankly we dont do let me give you the example of mexico they have a vat tax were on a different system when we sell into mexico there a tax when they sell in  automatic 16 percent approximately when they sell into us there no tax it a defective agreement it been defective for a long time many years but the politicians havent done anything about it now in all fairness to secretary clinton  yes is that ok good i want you to be very happy it very important to me but in all fairness to secretary clinton when she started talking about this it was really very recently she been doing this for 30 years and why hasnt she made the agreements better the nafta agreement is defective just because of the tax and many other reasons but just because of the fact secretary clinton and others politicians should have been doing this for years not right now because of the fact that weve created a movement they should have been doing this for years what happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is  look we owe 20 trillion we cannot do it any longer lester well the first thing you do is dont let the jobs leave the companies are leaving i could name i mean there are thousands of them theyre leaving and theyre leaving in bigger numbers than ever and what you do is you say fine you want to go to mexico or some other country good luck we wish you a lot of luck but if you think youre going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax youre wrong and once you say youre going to have to tax them coming in and our politicians never do this because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave because in many cases they own the companies so what im saying is we can stop them from leaving we have to stop them from leaving and that a big big factor that called business by the way i did not i did not i do not say that i do not say that she talks about solar panels we invested in a solar company our country that was a disaster they lost plenty of money on that one now look im a great believer in all forms of energy but were putting a lot of people out of work our energy policies are a disaster our country is losing so much in terms of energy in terms of paying off our debt you cant do what youre looking to do with 20 trillion in debt the obama administration from the time theyve come in is over 230 years worth of debt and he topped it he doubled it in a course of almost eight years sevenandahalf years to be semi exact so i will tell you this we have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs and we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand because theyre not doing it and all you have to do is look at michigan and look at ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving theyre gone and hillary id just ask you this youve been doing this for 30 years why are you just thinking about these solutions right now for 30 years youve been doing it and now youre just starting to think of solutions i will bring  excuse me i will bring back jobs you cant bring back jobs yeah for 30 years well he approved nafta he approved nafta which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country but you havent done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to you havent done it you havent done it excuse me your husband signed nafta which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry you go to new england you go to ohio pennsylvania you go anywhere you want secretary clinton and you will see devastation where manufacture is down 30 40 sometimes 50 percent nafta is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere but certainly ever signed in this country and now you want to approve transpacific partnership you were totally in favor of it then you heard what i was saying how bad it is and you said i cant win that debate but you know that if you did win you would approve that and that will be almost as bad as nafta nothing will ever top nafta you called it the gold standard you called it the gold standard of trade deals you said it the finest deal youve ever seen and then you heard what i said about it and all of a sudden you were against it not so is it president obama fault is it president obama fault secretary is it president obama fault because he pushing it but you have no plan secretary you have no plan that about all youve you are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history you are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history you are going to drive business out your regulations are a disaster and youre going to increase regulations all over the place and by the way my tax cut is the biggest since ronald reagan im very proud of it it will create tremendous numbers of new jobs but regulations you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence when i go around  lester i tell you this ive been all over and when i go around despite the tax cut the thing  the things that business as in people like the most is the fact that im cutting regulation you have regulations on top of regulations and new companies cannot form and old companies are going out of business and you want to increase the regulations and make them even worse im going to cut regulations im going to cut taxes big league and youre going to raise taxes big league end of story facts and take a look at mine also and youll see well could i just finish  i think i i think i should  you go to her website and you take a look at her website she going to raise taxes 13 trillion and look at her website you know what it no difference than this she telling us how to fight isis just go to her website she tells you how to fight isis on her website i dont think general douglas macarthur would like that too much no no youre telling the enemy everything you want to do see youre telling the enemy everything you want to do no wonder youve been fighting  no wonder youve been fighting isis your entire adult life well im really calling for major jobs because the wealthy are going create tremendous jobs theyre going to expand their companies theyre going to do a tremendous job im getting rid of the carried interest provision and if you really look it not a tax  it really not a great thing for the wealthy it a great thing for the middle class it a great thing for companies to expand and when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies and when theyre going to bring 25 trillion back from overseas where they cant bring the money back because politicians like secretary clinton wont allow them to bring the money back because the taxes are so onerous and the bureaucratic red tape so what  is so bad so what theyre doing is theyre leaving our country and theyre believe it or not leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country and instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work because they cant work out a deal to  and everybody agrees it should be brought back instead of that theyre leaving our country to get their money because they cant bring their money back into our country because of bureaucratic red tape because they cant get together because we have  we have a president that cant sit them around a table and get them to approve something and here the thing republicans and democrats agree that this should be done 25 trillion i happen to think it double that it probably 5 trillion that we cant bring into our country lester and with a little leadership youd get it in here very quickly and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things and it would be beautiful but we have no leadership and honestly that starts with secretary clinton why not there nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into their country yes then you didnt read it who gave it that name the first ive  who gave it that name how much how much for my family lester how much typical politician all talk no action sounds good doesnt work never going to happen our country is suffering because people like secretary clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of what going on now look we have the worst revival of an economy since the great depression and believe me were in a bubble right now and the only thing that looks good is the stock market but if you raise interest rates even a little bit that going to come crashing down we are in a big fat ugly bubble and we better be awfully careful and we have a fed that doing political things this janet yellen of the fed the fed is doing political  by keeping the interest rates at this level and believe me the day obama goes off and he leaves and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf when they raise interest rates youre going to see some very bad things happen because the fed is not doing their job the fed is being more political than secretary clinton i dont mind releasing  im under a routine audit and itll be released and  as soon as the audit finished it will be released but you will learn more about donald trump by going down to the federal elections where i filed a 104page essentially financial statement of sorts the forms that they have it shows income  in fact the income  i just looked today  the income is filed at 694 million for this past year 694 million if you would have told me i was going to make that 15 or 20 years ago i would have been very surprised but that the kind of thinking that our country needs when we have a country that doing so badly that being ripped off by every single country in the world it the kind of thinking that our country needs because everybody  lester we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with of almost 800 billion a year you know what that is that means who negotiating these trade deals we have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals excuse me well i told you i will release them as soon as the audit look ive been under audit almost for 15 years i know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited i said do you get audited i get audited almost every year and in a way i should be complaining im not even complaining i dont mind it it almost become a way of life i get audited by the irs but other people dont i will say this we have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of i will release my tax returns  against my lawyer wishes  when she releases her 33000 emails that have been deleted as soon as she releases them i will release i will release my tax returns and that against  my lawyers they say dont do it i will tell you this no  in fact watching shows theyre reading the papers almost every lawyer says you dont release your returns until the audit complete when the audit complete ill do it but i would go against them if she releases her emails it not negotiable no let her release the emails why did she delete 33000 that makes me smart that was more than a mistake that was done purposely ok that was not a mistake that was done purposely when you have your staff taking the fifth amendment taking the fifth so theyre not prosecuted when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the fifth i think it disgraceful and believe me this country thinks it  really thinks it disgraceful also as far as my tax returns you dont learn that much from tax returns that i can tell you you learn a lot from financial disclosure and you should go down and take a look at that the other thing im extremely underleveraged the report that said 650  which by the way a lot of friends of mine that know my business say boy that really not a lot of money it not a lot of money relative to what i had the buildings that were in question they said in the same report which was  actually it wasnt even a bad story to be honest with you but the buildings are worth 39 billion and the 650 isnt even on that but it not 650 it much less than that but i could give you a list of banks i would  if that would help you i would give you a list of banks these are very fine institutions very fine banks i could do that very quickly i am very underleveraged i have a great company i have a tremendous income and the reason i say that is not in a braggadocios way it because it about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money when we have 20 trillion in debt and our country a mess you know it one thing to have 20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our bridges are good and everything in great shape our airports our airports are like from a third world country you land at laguardia you land at kennedy you land at lax you land at newark and you come in from dubai and qatar and you see these incredible  you come in from china you see these incredible airports and you land  weve become a third world country so the worst of all things has happened we owe 20 trillion and were a mess we havent even started and weve spent 6 trillion in the middle east according to a report that i just saw whether it 6 or 5 but it looks like it 6 6 trillion in the middle east we could have rebuilt our country twice and it really a shame and it politicians like secretary clinton that have caused this problem our country has tremendous problems were a debtor nation were a serious debtor nation and we have a country that needs new roads new tunnels new bridges new airports new schools new hospitals and we dont have the money because it been squandered on so many of your ideas it would be squandered too believe me maybe he didnt do a good job and i was unsatisfied with his work which our country should do too wrong wrong so yeah i think  i do think it time look it all words it all sound bites i built an unbelievable company some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world real estate assets anywhere in the world beyond the united states in europe lots of different places it an unbelievable company but on occasion four times we used certain laws that are there and when secretary clinton talks about people that didnt get paid first of all they did get paid a lot but taken advantage of the laws of the nation now if you want to change the laws youve been there a long time change the laws but i take advantage of the laws of the nation because im running a company my obligation right now is to do well for myself my family my employees for my companies and that what i do but what she doesnt say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me ill give you an example were just opening up on pennsylvania avenue right next to the white house so if i dont get there one way im going to get to pennsylvania avenue another but were opening the old post office under budget ahead of schedule saved tremendous money im a year ahead of schedule and that what this country should be doing we build roads and they cost two and three and four times what theyre supposed to cost we buy products for our military and they come in at costs that are so far above what they were supposed to be because we dont have people that know what theyre doing when we look at the budget the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy the trump international is way under budget and way ahead of schedule and we should be able to do that for our country well first of all secretary clinton doesnt want to use a couple of words and that law and order and we need law and order if we dont have it were not going to have a country and when i look at what going on in charlotte a city i love a city where i have investments when i look at what going on throughout various parts of our country whether it  i mean i can just keep naming them all day long  we need law and order in our country i just got today the as you know the endorsement of the fraternal order of police we just  just came in we have endorsements from i think almost every police group very  i mean a large percentage of them in the united states we have a situation where we have our inner cities african americans hispanics are living in hell because it so dangerous you walk down the street you get shot in chicago theyve had thousands of shootings thousands since january 1st thousands of shootings and im saying where is this is this a wartorn country what are we doing and we have to stop the violence we have to bring back law and order in a place like chicago where thousands of people have been killed thousands over the last number of years in fact almost 4000 have been killed since barack obama became president over  almost 4000 people in chicago have been killed we have to bring back law and order now whether or not in a place like chicago you do stop and frisk which worked very well mayor giuliani is here worked very well in new york it brought the crime rate way down but you take the gun away from criminals that shouldnt be having it we have gangs roaming the street and in many cases theyre illegally here illegal immigrants and they have guns and they shoot people and we have to be very strong and we have to be very vigilant we have to be  we have to know what were doing right now our police in many cases are afraid to do anything we have to protect our inner cities because africanamerican communities are being decimated by crime decimated no youre wrong it went before a judge who was a very againstpolice judge it was taken away from her and our mayor our new mayor refused to go forward with the case they would have won an appeal if you look at it throughout the country there are many places where it allowed no the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldnt have them these are felons these are people that are bad people that shouldnt be  when you have 3000 shootings in chicago from january 1st when you have 4000 people killed in chicago by guns from the beginning of the presidency of barack obama his hometown you have to have stopandfrisk you need more police you need a better community you know relation you dont have good community relations in chicago it terrible i have property there it terrible what going on in chicago but when you look  and chicago not the only  you go to ferguson you go to so many different places you need better relationships i agree with secretary clinton on this you need better relationships between the communities and the police because in some cases it not good but you look at dallas where the relationships were really studied the relationships were really a beautiful thing and then five police officers were killed one night very violently so there some bad things going on some really bad things but we need  lester we need law and order and we need law and order in the inner cities because the people that are most affected by what happening are africanamerican and hispanic people and it very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen ugh id like to respond to that first of all i agree and a lot of people even within my own party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no fly lists i agree with you when a person is on a watch list or a nofly list and i have the endorsement of the nra which im very proud of these are very very good people and theyre protecting the second amendment but i think we have to look very strongly at nofly lists and watch lists and when people are on there even if they shouldnt be on there well help them well help them legally well help them get off but i tend to agree with that quite strongly i do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words superpredator about young black youth and that a term that i think was a  it  it been horribly met as you know i think youve apologized for it but i think it was a terrible thing to say and when it comes to stopandfrisk you know youre talking about takes guns away well im talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them and i dont think  i really dont think you disagree with me on this if you want to know the truth i think maybe there a political reason why you cant say it but i really dont believe  in new york city stopandfrisk we had 2200 murders and stopandfrisk brought it down to 500 murders five hundred murders is a lot of murders it hard to believe 500 is like supposed to be good but we went from 2200 to 500 and it was continued on by mayor bloomberg and it was terminated by current mayor but stopand frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of new york city tremendous beyond belief so when you say it has no impact it really did it had a very very big impact no youre wrong youre wrong murders are up all right you check it id like to just respond if i might id just like to respond i will look the africanamerican community has been let down by our politicians they talk good around election time like right now and after the election they said see ya later ill see you in four years the africanamerican community  because  look the community within the inner cities has been so badly treated theyve been abused and used in order to get votes by democrat politicians because that what it is theyve controlled these communities for up to 100 years and i will tell you you look at the inner cities  and i just left detroit and i just left philadelphia and i just  you know youve seen me ive been all over the place you decided to stay home and that ok but i will tell you ive been all over and ive met some of the greatest people ill ever meet within these communities and they are very very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done ill tell you very  well just very simple to say sidney blumenthal works for the campaign and close  very close friend of secretary clinton and her campaign manager patti doyle went to  during the campaign her campaign against president obama fought very hard and you can go look it up and you can check it out and if you look at cnn this past week patti solis doyle was on wolf blitzer saying that this happened blumenthal sent mcclatchy highly respected reporter at mcclatchy to kenya to find out about it they were pressing it very hard she failed to get the birth certificate when i got involved i didnt fail i got him to give the birth certificate so im satisfied with it and ill tell you why im satisfied with it because i want to get on to defeating isis because i want to get on to creating jobs because i want to get on to having a strong border because i want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country yeah well nobody was pressing it nobody was caring much about it i figured youd ask the question tonight of course but nobody was caring much about it but i was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate and i think i did a good job secretary clinton also fought it i mean you know  now everybody in mainstream is going to say oh that not true look it true sidney blumenthal sent a reporter  you just have to take a look at cnn the last week the interview with your former campaign manager and she was involved but just like she cant bring back jobs she cant produce well it was very  i say nothing i say nothing because i was able to get him to produce it he should have produced it a long time before i say nothing but let me just tell you when you talk about healing i think that ive developed very very good relationships over the last little while with the africanamerican community i think you can see that and i feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion and i think i did a great job and a great service not only for the country but even for the president in getting him to produce his birth certificate i would love to respond first of all i got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against barack obama you treated him with terrible disrespect and i watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are it doesnt work that way you were after him you were trying to  you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb very famous pictures i dont think you can deny that but just last week your campaign manager said it was true so when you tried to act holier than thou it really doesnt work it really doesnt now as far as the lawsuit yes when i was very young i went into my father company had a real estate company in brooklyn and queens and we along with many many other companies throughout the country  it was a federal lawsuit  were sued we settled the suit with zero  with no admission of guilt it was very easy to do i notice you bring that up a lot and you know i also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways which i dont do on you maybe im trying to save the money but frankly i look  i look at that and i say isnt that amazing because i settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms and it just one of those things ill go one step further in palm beach florida tough community a brilliant community a wealthy community probably the wealthiest community there is in the world i opened a club and really got great credit for it no discrimination against african americans against muslims against anybody and it a tremendously successful club and im so glad i did it and i have been given great credit for what i did and im very very proud of it and that the way i feel that is the true way i feel i do want to say that i was just endorsed  and more are coming next week  it will be over 200 admirals many of them here  admirals and generals endorsed me to lead this country that just happened and many more are coming and im very proud of it in addition i was just endorsed by ice theyve never endorsed anybody before on immigration i was just endorsed by ice i was just recently endorsed  16500 border patrol agents so when secretary clinton talks about this i mean ill take the admirals and ill take the generals any day over the political hacks that i see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge ok because look at the mess that were in look at the mess that were in as far as the cyber i agree to parts of what secretary clinton said we should be better than anybody else and perhaps were not i dont think anybody knows it was russia that broke into the dnc she saying russia russia russia but i dont  maybe it was i mean it could be russia but it could also be china it could also be lots of other people it also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds ok you dont know who broke in to dnc but what did we learn with dnc we learned that bernie sanders was taken advantage of by your people by debbie wasserman schultz look what happened to her but bernie sanders was taken advantage of that what we learned now whether that was russia whether that was china whether it was another country we dont know because the truth is under president obama weve lost control of things that we used to have control over we came in with the internet we came up with the internet and i think secretary clinton and myself would agree very much when you look at what isis is doing with the internet theyre beating us at our own game isis so we have to get very very tough on cyber and cyber warfare it is  it is a huge problem i have a son he 10 years old he has computers he is so good with these computers it unbelievable the security aspect of cyber is very very tough and maybe it hardly doable but i will say we are not doing the job we should be doing but that true throughout our whole governmental society we have so many things that we have to do better lester and certainly cyber is one of them well first i have to say one thing very important secretary clinton is talking about taking out isis we will take out isis well president obama and secretary clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of iraq because they got out  what they shouldnt have been in but once they got in the way they got out was a disaster and isis was formed so she talks about taking them out she been doing it a long time she been trying to take them out for a long time but they wouldnt have even been formed if they left some troops behind like 10000 or maybe something more than that and then you wouldnt have had them or as ive been saying for a long time and i think youll agree because i said it to you once had we taken the oil  and we should have taken the oil  isis would not have been able to form either because the oil was their primary source of income and now they have the oil all over the place including the oil  a lot of the oil in libya which was another one of her disasters wrong wrong wrong well i have to respond the secretary said very strongly about working with  weve been working with them for many years and we have the greatest mess anyone ever seen you look at the middle east it a total mess under your direction to a large extent but you look at the middle east you started the iran deal that another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall i mean they were doing so badly they were choking on the sanctions and now theyre going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon the way theyre going but when you look at nato i was asked on a major show what do you think of nato and you have to understand im a businessperson i did really well but i have common sense and i said well ill tell you i havent given lots of thought to nato but two things number one the 28 countries of nato many of them arent paying their fair share number two  and that bothers me because we should be asking  were defending them and they should at least be paying us what theyre supposed to be paying by treaty and contract and number two i said and very strongly nato could be obsolete because  and i was very strong on this and it was actually covered very accurately in the new york times which is unusual for the new york times to be honest  but i said they do not focus on terror and i was very strong and i said it numerous times and about four months ago i read on the front page of the wall street journal that nato is opening up a major terror division and i think that great and i think we should get  because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of nato it a lot of money to protect other people but im all for nato but i said they have to focus on terror also and theyre going to do that and that was  believe me  im sure im not going to get credit for it  but that was largely because of what i was saying and my criticism of nato i think we have to get nato to go into the middle east with us in addition to surrounding nations and we have to knock the hell out of isis and we have to do it fast when isis formed in this vacuum created by barack obama and secretary clinton and believe me you were the ones that took out the troops not only that you named the day they couldnt believe it they sat back probably and said i cant believe it they said no wait a minute when they formed when they formed this is something that never should have happened it should have never happened now youre talking about taking out isis but you were there and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant now it in over 30 countries and youre going to stop them i dont think so i did not support the war in iraq that is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her because she  frankly i think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media just  would you like to hear wait a minute i was against the war in iraq just so you put it out the record does not show that the record shows that im right when i did an interview with howard stern very lightly first time anyone asked me that i said very lightly i dont know maybe who knows essentially i then did an interview with neil cavuto we talked about the economy is more important i then spoke to sean hannity which everybody refuses to call sean hannity i had numerous conversations with sean hannity at fox and sean hannity said  and he called me the other day  and i spoke to him about it  he said you were totally against the war because he was for the war and when he  excuse me and that was before the war started sean hannity said very strongly to me and other people  he willing to say it but nobody wants to call him i was against the war he said you used to have fights with me because sean was in favor of the war and i understand that side also not very much because we should have never been there but nobody called sean hannity and then they did an article in a major magazine shortly after the war started i think in 04 but they did an article which had me totally against the war in iraq and one of your compatriots said you know whether it was before or right after trump was definitely  because if you read this article there no doubt but if somebody  and ill ask the press  if somebody would call up sean hannity this was before the war started he and i used to have arguments about the war i said it a terrible and a stupid thing it going to destabilize the middle east and that exactly what it done it been a disaster no no you didnt hear what i said well i have much better judgment than she does there no question about that i also have a much better temperament than she has you know i have a much better  she spent  let me tell you  she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising  you know they get madison avenue into a room they put names  oh temperament let go after  i think my strongest asset maybe by far is my temperament i have a winning temperament i know how to win she does not have a wait the aflcio the other day behind the blue screen i dont know who you were talking to secretary clinton but you were totally out of control i said there a person with a temperament that got a problem that would not start a war no they were taunting us wrong it lies that line getting a little bit old i must say i would like to it not an accurate one at all it not an accurate one so i just want to give a lot of things  and just to respond i agree with her on one thing the single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament nuclear weapons not global warming like you think and your  your president thinks nuclear is the single greatest threat just to go down the list we defend japan we defend germany we defend south korea we defend saudi arabia we defend countries they do not pay us but they should be paying us because we are providing tremendous service and were losing a fortune that why were losing  were losing  we lose on everything i say who makes these  we lose on everything all i said that it very possible that if they dont pay a fair share because this isnt 40 years ago where we could do what were doing we cant defend japan a behemoth selling us cars by the million well wait but it very important all i said was they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out were a country that owes 20 trillion they have to help us out as far as the nuclear is concerned i agree it is the single greatest threat that this country has well i have to say that you know for what secretary clinton was saying about nuclear with russia she very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries but russia has been expanding their  they have a much newer capability than we do we have not been updating from the new standpoint i looked the other night i was seeing b52s theyre old enough that your father your grandfather could be flying them we are not  we are not keeping up with other countries i would like everybody to end it just get rid of it but i would certainly not do first strike i think that once the nuclear alternative happens it over at the same time we have to be prepared i cant take anything off the table because you look at some of these countries you look at north korea were doing nothing there china should solve that problem for us china should go into north korea china is totally powerful as it relates to north korea and by the way another one powerful is the worst deal i think ive ever seen negotiated that you started is the iran deal iran is one of their biggest trading partners iran has power over north korea and when they made that horrible deal with iran they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to north korea and they should have done something with respect to yemen and all these other places and when asked to secretary kerry why didnt you do that why didnt you add other things into the deal one of the great giveaways of all time of all time including 400 million in cash nobody ever seen that before that turned out to be wrong it was actually 17 billion in cash obviously i guess for the hostages it certainly looks that way so you say to yourself why didnt they make the right deal this is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history the deal with iran will lead to nuclear problems all they have to do is sit back 10 years and they dont have to do much and theyre going to end up getting nuclear i met with bibi netanyahu the other day believe me he not a happy camper lester one thing id like to say i will go very quickly but i will tell you that hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat isis which she could have defeated by never having it you know get going in the first place right now it getting tougher and tougher to defeat them because theyre in more and more places more and more states more and more nations and it a big problem and as far as japan is concerned i want to help all of our allies but we are losing billions and billions of dollars we cannot be the policemen of the world we cannot protect countries all over the world  where theyre not paying us what we need and she doesnt say that because she got no business ability we need heart we need a lot of things but you have to have some basic ability and sadly she doesnt have that all of the things that she talking about could have been taken care of during the last 10 years let say while she had great power but they werent taken care of and if she ever wins this race they wont be taken care of she doesnt have the look she doesnt have the stamina i said she doesnt have the stamina and i dont believe she does have the stamina to be president of this country you need tremendous stamina you have  wait a minute wait a minute lester you asked me a question did you ask me a question you have to be able to negotiate our trade deals you have to be able to negotiate that right with japan with saudi arabia i mean can you imagine were defending saudi arabia and with all of the money they have were defending them and theyre not paying all you have to do is speak to them wait you have so many different things you have to be able to do and i dont believe that hillary has the stamina the world  let me tell you let me tell you hillary has experience but it bad experience we have made so many bad deals during the last  so she got experience that i agree but it bad bad experience whether it the iran deal that youre so in love with where we gave them 150 billion back whether it the iran deal whether it anything you can  name  you almost cant name a good deal i agree she got experience but it bad experience and this country cant afford to have another four years of that kind of experience i never said that i didnt say that where did you find this where did you find this where did you find this oh really clinton ok good let me just tell you you know hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials some of it said in entertainment some of it said  somebody who been very vicious to me rosie odonnell i said very tough things to her and i think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her but you want to know the truth i was going to say something  extremely rough to hillary to her family and i said to myself i cant do it i just cant do it it inappropriate it not nice but she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me many of which are absolutely untrue theyre untrue and theyre misrepresentations and i will tell you this lester it not nice and i dont deserve that but it certainly not a nice thing that she done it hundreds of millions of ads and the only gratifying thing is i saw the polls come in today and with all of that money  200 million is spent and im either winning or tied and ive spent practically nothing the other day we were deporting 800 people and perhaps they passed the wrong button they pressed the wrong button or perhaps worse than that it was corruption but these people that we were going to deport for good reason ended up becoming citizens ended up becoming citizens and it was 800 and now it turns out it might be 1800 and they dont even know look here the story i want to make america great again im going to be able to do it i dont believe hillary will the answer is if she wins i will absolutely support her
1,well i actually agree with that i agree with everything she said i began this campaign because i was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country this is a great country this is a great land ive gotten to know the people of the country over the last yearandahalf that ive been doing this as a politician i cannot believe im saying that about myself but i guess i have been a politician  and my whole concept was to make america great again when i watch the deals being made when i watch what happening with some horrible things like obamacare where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical 68 percent 59 percent 71 percent when i look at the iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us it a onesided transaction where were giving back 150 billion to a terrorist state really the number one terror state weve made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago when i look at all of the things that i see and all of the potential that our country has we have such tremendous potential whether it in business and trade where were doing so badly last year we had almost 800 billion trade deficit in other words trading with other countries we had an 800 billion deficit it hard to believe inconceivable you say who making these deals were going the make great deals were going to have a strong border were going to bring back law and order just today policemen was shot two killed and this is happening on a weekly basis we have to bring back respect to law enforcement at the same time we have to take care of people on all sides we need justice but i want to do things that havent been done including fixing and making our inner cities better for the africanamerican citizens that are so great and for the latinos hispanics and i look forward to doing it it called make america great again  no i didnt say that at all i dont think you understood what was  this was locker room talk im not proud of it i apologize to my family i apologize to the american people certainly im not proud of it but this is locker room talk you know when we have a world where you have isis chopping off heads where you have  and frankly drowning people in steel cages where you have wars and horrible horrible sights all over where you have so many bad things happening this is like medieval times we havent seen anything like this the carnage all over the world and they look and they see can you imagine the people that are frankly doing so well against us with isis and they look at our country and they see what going on yes im very embarrassed by it i hate it but it locker room talk and it one of those things i will knock the hell out of isis were going to defeat isis isis happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment and i will tell you i will take care of isis  and we should get on to much more important things and much bigger things  i have great respect for women nobody has more respect for women than i do  ive said things that frankly you hear these things i said and i was embarrassed by it but i have tremendous respect for women  and women have respect for me and i will tell you no i have not and i will tell you that im going to make our country safe were going to have borders in our country which we dont have now people are pouring into our country and theyre coming in from the middle east and other places were going to make america safe again were going to make america great again but were going to make america safe again and were going to make america wealthy again because if you dont do that it just  it sounds harsh to say but we have to build up the wealth of our nation  right now other nations are taking our jobs and theyre taking our wealth  and that what i want to talk about  am i allowed to respond to that i assume i am  it just words folks it just words those words ive been hearing them for many years i heard them when they were running for the senate in new york where hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate new york and she failed ive heard them where hillary is constantly talking about the inner cities of our country which are a disaster educationwise jobwise safetywise in every way possible im going to help the africanamericans im going to help the latinos hispanics i am going to help the inner cities she done a terrible job for the africanamericans she wants their vote and she does nothing and then she comes back four years later we saw that firsthand when she was united states senator she campaigned where the primary part of her campaign  so she allowed to do that but im not allowed to respond  sounds fair  it was locker room talk as i told you that was locker room talk im not proud of it i am a person who has great respect for people for my family for the people of this country and certainly im not proud of it but that was something that happened if you look at bill clinton far worse mine are words and his was action his was what he done to women there never been anybody in the history politics in this nation that been so abusive to women so you can say any way you want to say it but bill clinton was abusive to women hillary clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously four of them here tonight one of the women who is a wonderful woman at 12 years old was raped at 12 her client she represented got him off and she seen laughing on two separate occasions laughing at the girl who was raped kathy shelton that young woman is here with us tonight so dont tell me about words i am absolutely  i apologize for those words but it is things that people say but what president clinton did he was impeached he lost his license to practice law he had to pay an 850000 fine to one of the women paula jones who also here tonight and i will tell you that when hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that i said 11 years ago i think it disgraceful and i think she should be ashamed of herself if you want to know the truth well you owe the president an apology because as you know very well your campaign sidney blumenthal  he another real winner that you have  and he the one that got this started along with your campaign manager and they were on television just two weeks ago she was saying exactly that so you really owe him an apology youre the one that sent the pictures around your campaign sent the pictures around with president obama in a certain garb that was long before i was ever involved so you actually owe an apology number two michelle obama ive gotten to see the commercials that they did on you and ive gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials ive ever seen of michelle obama talking about you hillary so you talk about friend go back and take a look at those commercials a race where you lost fair and square unlike the bernie sanders race where you won but not fair and square in my opinion and all you have to do is take a look at wikileaks and just see what they say about bernie sanders and see what deborah wasserman schultz had in mind because bernie sanders between superdelegates and deborah wasserman schultz he never had a chance and i was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil but when you talk about apology i think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33000 emails that you deleted and that you acid washed and then the two boxes of emails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing and ill tell you what i didnt think id say this but im going to say it and i hate to say it but if i win i am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation because there has never been so many lies so much deception there has never been anything like it and were going to have a special prosecutor when i speak i go out and speak the people of this country are furious in my opinion the people that have been longterm workers at the fbi are furious there has never been anything like this where emails  and you get a subpoena you get a subpoena and after getting the subpoena you delete 33000 emails and then you acid wash them or bleach them as you would say very expensive process so were going to get a special prosecutor and were going to look into it because you know what people have been  their lives have been destroyed for doing onefifth of what youve done and it a disgrace and honestly you ought to be ashamed of yourself  oh really  because youd be in jail and yet she didnt know the word  the letter c on a document right she didnt even know what that word  what that letter meant you know it amazing im watching hillary go over facts and she going after fact after fact and she lying again because she said she  you know what she did with the email was fine you think it was fine to delete 33000 emails i dont think so she said the 33000 emails had to do with her daughter wedding number one and a yoga class well maybe well give three or three or four or five or something 33000 emails deleted and now she saying there wasnt anything wrong and more importantly that was after getting a subpoena that wasnt before that was after she got it from the united states congress and ill be honest i am so disappointed in congressmen including republicans for allowing this to happen our justice department where our husband goes on to the back of a airplane for 39 minutes talks to the attorney general days before a ruling is going to be made on her case but for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39000 emails again you should be ashamed of yourself what you did  and this is after getting a subpoena from the united states congress  you did that wait a minute one second  if you did that in the private sector youd be put in jail let alone after getting a subpoena from the united states congress  oh you didnt delete them  oh 33000 yeah  oh yeah what about the other 15000  because you have nothing to say  get off this question  let see what happens id like to know anderson why arent you bringing up the emails id like to know why arent you bringing  no it hasnt it hasnt and it hasnt been finished at all  it nice to  one on three no im a gentlemen hillary go ahead it is such a great question and it maybe the question i get almost more than anything else outside of defense obamacare is a disaster you know it we all know it it going up at numbers that nobody ever seen worldwide nobody ever seen numbers like this for health care it only getting worse in 17 it implodes by itself their method of fixing it is to go back and ask congress for more money more and more money we have right now almost 20 trillion in debt obamacare will never work it very bad very bad health insurance far too expensive and not only expensive for the person that has it unbelievably expensive for our country it going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly we have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works where your plan can actually be tailored we have to get rid of the lines around the state artificial lines where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing because they want  and president obama and whoever was working on it  they want to leave those lines because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies we want competition you will have the finest health care plan there is she wants to go to a singlepayer plan which would be a disaster somewhat similar to canada and if you havent noticed the canadians when they need a big operation when something happens they come into the united states in many cases because their system is so slow it catastrophic in certain ways but she wants to go to single payer which means the government basically rules everything hillary clinton has been after this for years obamacare was the first step obamacare is a total disaster and not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobody ever believed but your deductibles are going up so that unless you get hit by a truck youre never going to be able to use it  it is a disastrous plan and it has to be repealed and replaced  well i just want  just one thing first of all hillary everything broken about it everything number two bernie sanders said that hillary clinton has very bad judgment this is a perfect example of it trying to save obamacare which is a disaster  by the way  were going to be able to youre going to have plans  well ill tell you what it means youre going to have plans that are so good because were going to have so much competition in the insurance industry once we break out  once we break out the lines and allow the competition to come  president obama  anderson excuse me president obama by keeping those lines the boundary lines around each state it was almost gone until just very toward the end of the passage of obamacare which by the way was a fraud you know that because jonathan gruber the architect of obamacare was said  he said it was a great lie it was a big lie president obama said you keep your doctor you keep your plan the whole thing was a fraud and it doesnt work but when we get rid of those lines you will have competition and we will be able to keep preexisting well also be able to help people that cant get  dont have money because we are going to have people protected and republicans feel this way believe it or not and strongly this way were going to block grant into the states were going to block grant into medicaid into the states   so that we will be able to take care of people without the necessary funds to take care of themselves  well youre right about islamophobia and that a shame but one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that  because there is a problem i mean whether we like it or not and we could be very politically correct but whether we like it or not there is a problem and we have to be sure that muslims come in and report when they see something going on when they see hatred going on they have to report it as an example in san bernardino many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many many people horribly wounded theyll never be the same muslims have to report the problems when they see them and you know there always a reason for everything if they dont do that it a very difficult situation for our country because you look at orlando and you look at san bernardino and you look at the world trade center go outside look at paris look at that horrible  these are radical islamic terrorists and she wont even mention the word and nor will president obama he wont use the term radical islamic terrorism now to solve a problem you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name she wont say the name and president obama wont say the name but the name is there it radical islamic terror and before you solve it you have to say the name  first of all captain khan is an american hero and if i were president at that time he would be alive today because unlike her who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing i would not have had our people in iraq iraq was disaster so he would have been alive today the muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into a extreme vetting from certain areas of the world hillary clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands  excuse me excuse me  why dont you interrupt her you interrupt me all the time  why dont you interrupt her  it called extreme vetting we are going to areas like syria where theyre coming in by the tens of thousands because of barack obama and hillary clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over obama people are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are where they are from what their feelings about our country is and she wants 550 percent more this is going to be the great trojan horse of all time we have enough problems in this country i believe in building safe zones i believe in having other people pay for them as an example the gulf states who are not carrying their weight but they have nothing but money and take care of people but i dont want to have with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on hundreds of thousands of people coming in from syria when we know nothing about them we know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love for our country  that not been debunked  that has not been debunked  i was against  i was against the war in iraq has not been debunked and you voted for it and you shouldnt have well i just want to say  excuse me she just went about 25 seconds over her time  could i just respond to this please  hillary clinton in terms of having people come into our country we have many criminal illegal aliens when we want to send them back to their country their country says we dont want them in some cases theyre murderers drug lords drug problems and they dont want them and hillary clinton when she was secretary of state said that ok we cant force it into their country let me tell you im going to force them right back into their country theyre murderers and some very bad people and i will tell you very strongly when bernie sanders said she had bad judgment she has really bad judgment because we are letting people into this country that are going to cause problems and crime like youve never seen were also letting drugs pour through our southern border at a record clip at a record clip and it shouldnt be allowed to happen ice just endorsed me theyve never endorsed a presidential candidate the border patrol agents 16500 just recently endorsed me and they endorsed me because i understand the border she doesnt she wants amnesty for everybody come right in come right over it a horrible thing she doing she got bad judgment and honestly so bad that she should never be president of the united states that i can tell you  well i think i should respond because  so ridiculous look now she blaming  she got caught in a total lie her papers went out to all her friends at the banks goldman sachs and everybody else and she said things  wikileaks that just came out and she lied now she blaming the lie on the late great abraham lincoln that one that i havent  ok honest abe honest abe never lied that the good thing that the big difference between abraham lincoln and you that a big big difference were talking about some difference but as far as other elements of what she was saying i dont know putin i think it would be great if we got along with russia because we could fight isis together as an example but i dont know putin but i notice anytime anything wrong happens they like to say the russians are  she doesnt know if it the russians doing the hacking maybe there is no hacking but they always blame russia and the reason they blame russia because they think theyre trying to tarnish me with russia i know nothing about russia i know  i know about russia but i know nothing about the inner workings of russia i dont deal there i have no businesses there i have no loans from russia i have a very very great balance sheet so great that when i did the old post office on pennsylvania avenue the united states government because of my balance sheet which they actually know very well chose me to do the old post office between the white house and congress chose me to do the old post office one of the primary area things in fact perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet but i have no loans with russia you could go to the united states government and they would probably tell you that because they know my sheet very well in order to get that development i had to have now the taxes are a very simple thing as soon as i have  first of all i pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes many of her friends took bigger deductions warren buffett took a massive deduction soros who a friend of hers took a massive deduction many of the people that are giving her all this money that she can do many more commercials than me gave her  took massive deductions i pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes but  but as soon as my routine audit is finished ill release my returns ill be very proud to theyre actually quite great  well one thing id do is get rid of carried interest one of the greatest provisions for people like me to be honest with you i give up a lot when i run because i knock out the tax code and she could have done this years ago by the way she a united states  she was a united states senator she complains that donald trump took advantage of the tax code well why didnt she change it why didnt you change it when you were a senator the reason you didnt is that all your friends take the same advantage that i do and i do you have provisions in the tax code that frankly we could change but you wouldnt change it because all of these people gave you the money so you can take negative ads on donald trump but  and i say that about a lot of things you know ive heard hillary complaining about so many different things over the years i wish you would have done this but she been there for 30 years she been doing this stuff she never changed and she never will change she never will change were getting rid of carried interest provisions im lowering taxes actually because i think it so important for corporations because we have corporations leaving  massive corporations and little ones little ones cant form were getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes but were bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent were cutting taxes for the middle class and i will tell you we are cutting them big league for the middle class and i will tell you hillary clinton is raising your taxes folks you can look at me she raising your taxes really high and what that going to do is a disaster for the country but she is raising your taxes and im lowering your taxes that in itself is a big difference we are going to be thriving again we have no growth in this country there no growth if china has a gdp of 7 percent it like a national catastrophe were down at 1 percent and that like no growth and were going lower in my opinion and a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high just about the highest in the world and im bringing them down to one of the lower in the world and i think it so important  one of the most important things we can do but she is raising everybody taxes massively  of course i do of course i do and so do all of her donors or most of her donors i know many of her donors her donors took massive tax writeoffs  a lot of my  excuse me anderson  a lot of my write off was depreciation and other things that hillary as a senator allowed and shell always allow it because the people that give her all this money they want it that why see i understand the tax code better than anybody that ever run for president hillary clinton  and it extremely complex  hillary clinton has friends that want all of these provisions including they want the carried interest provision which is very important to wall street people but they really want the carried interest provision which i believe hillary leaving very interesting why she leaving carried interest but i will tell you that number one i pay tremendous numbers of taxes i absolutely used it and so did warren buffett and so did george soros and so did many of the other people that hillary is getting money from now i wont mention their names because theyre rich but theyre not famous so we wont make them famous  no but i pay tax and i pay federal tax too but i have a writeoff a lot of it depreciation which is a wonderful charge i love depreciation you know she given it to us hey if she had a problem  for 30 years she been doing this anderson i say it all the time she talks about health care why didnt she do something about it she talks about taxes why didnt she do something about it she doesnt do anything about anything other than talk with her it all talk and no action  and again bernie sanders it really bad judgment she has made bad judgment not only on taxes she made bad judgments on libya on syria on iraq i mean her and obama whether you like it or not the way they got out of iraq the vacuum theyve left that why isis formed in the first place they started from that little area and now theyre in 32 different nations hillary congratulations great job  why didnt you do it why didnt you do it  oh really  you could have done it if you were an effective  if you were an effective senator you could have done it if you were an effective senator you could have done it but you were not an effective senator  she said a lot of things that were false i mean i think we should be allowed to maybe  excuse me because she has been a disaster as a senator a disaster  first of all she was there as secretary of state with the socalled line in the sand which  ok but you were in contact  excuse me you were  you were in total contact with the white house and perhaps sadly obama probably still listened to you i dont think he would be listening to you very much anymore obama draws the line in the sand it was laughed at all over the world what happened now with that being said she talks tough against russia but our nuclear program has fallen way behind and theyve gone wild with their nuclear program not good our government shouldnt have allowed that to happen russia is new in terms of nuclear we are old were tired were exhausted in terms of nuclear a very bad thing now she talks tough she talks really tough against putin and against assad she talks in favor of the rebels she doesnt even know who the rebels are you know every time we take rebels whether it in iraq or anywhere else were arming people and you know what happens they end up being worse than the people look at what she did in libya with gadhafi gadhafi out it a mess and by the way isis has a good chunk of their oil im sure you probably have heard that it was a disaster because the fact is almost everything she done in foreign policy has been a mistake and it been a disaster but if you look at russia just take a look at russia and look at what they did this week where i agree she wasnt there but possibly she consulted we sign a peace treaty everyone all excited well what russia did with assad and by the way with iran who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps ive ever seen in the history of dealmaking the iran deal with the 150 billion with the 17 billion in cash which is enough to fill up this room but look at that deal iran now and russia are now against us so she wants to fight she wants to fight for rebels there only one problem you dont even know who the rebels are so what the purpose  and one thing i have to say  i dont like assad at all but assad is killing isis russia is killing isis and iran is killing isis and those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy  ok he and i havent spoken and i disagree i disagree  i think you have to knock out isis right now syria is fighting isis we have people that want to fight both at the same time but syria is no longer syria syria is russia and it iran who she made strong and kerry and obama made into a very powerful nation and a very rich nation very very quickly very very quickly i believe we have to get isis we have to worry about isis before we can get too much more involved she had a chance to do something with syria they had a chance and that was the line and she didnt  i think aleppo is a disaster humanitarianwise  i think that it basically has fallen ok it basically has fallen let me tell you something you take a look at mosul the biggest problem i have with the stupidity of our foreign policy we have mosul they think a lot of the isis leaders are in mosul so we have announcements coming out of washington and coming out of iraq we will be attacking mosul in three weeks or four weeks well all of these bad leaders from isis are leaving mosul why cant they do it quietly why cant they do the attack make it a sneak attack and after the attack is made inform the american public that weve knocked out the leaders weve had a tremendous success people leave why do they have to say were going to be attacking mosul within the next four to six weeks which is what theyre saying how stupid is our country  i cant think of any i cant think of any and im pretty good at it  and we have general flynn and we have  look i have 200 generals and admirals who endorsed me i have 21 congressional medal of honor recipients who endorsed me we talk about it all the time they understand why cant they do something secretively where they go in and they knock out the leadership how  why would these people stay there ive been reading now   for weeks  ive been reading now for weeks about mosul that it the harbor of where  you know between raqqa and mosul this is where they think the isis leaders are why would they be saying  theyre not staying there anymore theyre gone because everybody talking about how iraq which is us with our leadership goes in to fight mosul now with these 200 admirals and generals they cant believe it all i say is this general george patton general douglas macarthur are spinning in their grave at the stupidity of what were doing in the middle east  everything  you know what funny she went over a minute over and you dont stop her when i go one second over it like a big deal  it really  it really very interesting  absolutely i mean she calls our people deplorable a large group and irredeemable i will be a president for all of our people and ill be a president that will turn our inner cities around and will give strength to people and will give economics to people and will bring jobs back because nafta signed by her husband is perhaps the greatest disaster trade deal in the history of the world not in this country it stripped us of manufacturing jobs we lost our jobs we lost our money we lost our plants it is a disaster and now she wants to sign tpp even though she says now she for it she called it the gold standard and by the way at the last debate she lied because it turned out that she did say the gold standard and she said she didnt say it they actually said that she lied ok and she lied but she lied about a lot of things  i would be a president for all of the people african americans the inner cities devastating what happening to our inner cities she been talking about it for years as usual she talks about it nothing happens she doesnt get it done same with the latino americans the hispanic americans the same exact thing they talk they dont get it done you go into the inner cities and  you see it 45 percent poverty african americans now 45 percent poverty in the inner cities the education is a disaster jobs are essentially nonexistent i mean it  you know and ive been saying at big speeches where i have 20000 and 30000 people what do you have to lose it cant get any worse and she been talking about the inner cities for 25 years nothing going to ever happen let me tell you if she president of the united states nothing going to happen it just going to be talk and all of her friends the taxes we were talking about and i would just get it by osmosis she not doing any me favors but by doing all the others favors she doing me favors  but i will tell you she all talk it doesnt get done all you have to do is take a look at her senate run take a look at upstate new york  it turned out to be a disaster   but we believed that we could make the country better and i was proud of that  we have a divided nation we have a very divided nation you look at charlotte you look at baltimore you look at the violence that taking place in the inner cities chicago you take a look at washington dc we have an increase in murder within our cities the biggest in 45 years we have a divided nation because people like her  and believe me she has tremendous hate in her heart and when she said deplorables she meant it and when she said irredeemable theyre irredeemable you didnt mention that but when she said theyre irredeemable to me that might have been even worse  she got tremendous  she got tremendous hatred and this country cannot take another four years of barack obama and that what youre getting with her  no there wasnt check out a sex tape it was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful girl scout who was no girl scout  by the way just so you understand when she said 3 oclock in the morning take a look at benghazi she said who is going to answer the call at 3 oclock in the morning guess what she didnt answer it because when ambassador stevens   600  wait a minute anderson 600 times well she said she was awake at 3 oclock in the morning and she also sent a tweet out at 3 oclock in the morning but i wont even mention that but she said shell be awake who going  the famous thing were going to answer our call at 3 oclock in the morning guess what happened ambassador stevens  ambassador stevens sent 600 requests for help and the only one she talked to was sidney blumenthal who her friend and not a good guy by the way so you know she shouldnt be talking about that now tweeting happens to be a modern day form of communication i mean you can like it or not like it i have between facebook and twitter i have almost 25 million people it a very effective way of communication so you can put it down but it is a very effective form of communication im not unproud of it to be honest with you  im shocked to hear that we have the slowest growth since 1929  it is  our country has the slowest growth and jobs are a disaster  justice scalia great judge died recently and we have a vacancy i am looking to appoint judges very much in the mold of justice scalia im looking for judges  and ive actually picked 20 of them so that people would see highly respected highly thought of and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody but people that will respect the constitution of the united states and i think that this is so important also the second amendment which is totally under siege by people like hillary clinton theyll respect the second amendment and what it stands for what it represents so important to me now hillary mentioned something about contributions just so you understand so i will have in my race more than 100 million put in  of my money meaning im not taking all of this big money from all of these different corporations like she doing what i ask is this so im putting in more than  by the time it finished ill have more than 100 million invested pretty much selffunding money were raising money for the republican party and were doing tremendously on the small donations 61 average or so i ask hillary why doesnt  she made 250 million by being in office she used the power of her office to make a lot of money why isnt she funding not for 100 million but why dont you put 10 million or 20 million or 25 million or 30 million into your own campaign it 30 million less for special interests that will tell you exactly what to do and it would really i think be a nice sign to the american public why arent you putting some money in you have a lot of it youve made a lot of it because of the fact that youve been in office made a lot of it while you were secretary of state actually so why arent you putting money into your own campaign im just curious  absolutely i think it such a great question because energy is under siege by the obama administration under absolutely siege the epa environmental protection agency is killing these energy companies and foreign companies are now coming in buying our  buying so many of our different plants and then rejiggering the plant so that they can take care of their oil we are killing  absolutely killing our energy business in this country now im all for alternative forms of energy including wind including solar et cetera but we need much more than wind and solar and you look at our miners hillary clinton wants to put all the miners out of business there is a thing called clean coal coal will last for 1000 years in this country now we have natural gas and so many other things because of technology we have unbelievable  we have found over the last seven years we have found tremendous wealth right under our feet so good especially when you have 20 trillion in debt i will bring our energy companies back theyll be able to compete theyll make money theyll pay off our national debt theyll pay off our tremendous budget deficits which are tremendous but we are putting our energy companies out of business we have to bring back our workers you take a look at what happening to steel and the cost of steel and china dumping vast amounts of steel all over the united states which essentially is killing our steelworkers and our steel companies we have to guard our energy companies we have to make it possible the epa is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business and all you have to do is go to a great place like west virginia or places like ohio which is phenomenal or places like pennsylvania and you see what theyre doing to the people miners and others in the energy business it a disgrace  it an absolute disgrace  well i consider her statement about my children to be a very nice compliment i dont know if it was meant to be a compliment but it is a great  im very proud of my children and theyve done a wonderful job and theyve been wonderful wonderful kids so i consider that a compliment i will say this about hillary she doesnt quit she doesnt give up i respect that i tell it like it is she a fighter i disagree with much of what she fighting for i do disagree with her judgment in many cases but she does fight hard and she doesnt quit and she doesnt give up and i consider that to be a very good trait
2,well first of all it great to be with you and thank you everybody the supreme court it what it all about our country is so so  it just so imperative that we have the right justices something happened recently where justice ginsburg made some very very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people many many millions of people that i represent and she was forced to apologize and apologize she did but these were statements that should never ever have been made we need a supreme court that in my opinion is going to uphold the second amendment and all amendments but the second amendment which is under absolute siege i believe if my opponent should win this race which i truly dont think will happen we will have a second amendment which will be a very very small replica of what it is right now but i feel that it absolutely important that we uphold because of the fact that it is under such trauma i feel that the justices that i am going to appoint  and ive named 20 of them  the justices that im going to appoint will be prolife they will have a conservative bent they will be protecting the second amendment they are great scholars in all cases and theyre people of tremendous respect they will interpret the constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted and i believe that very very important i dont think we should have justices appointed that decide what they want to hear it all about the constitution of  of  and so important the constitution the way it was meant to be and those are the people that i will appoint  well the dc vs heller decision was very strongly  and she was extremely angry about it i watched i mean she was very very angry when upheld and justice scalia was so involved and it was a wellcrafted decision but hillary was extremely upset extremely angry and people that believe in the second amendment and believe in it very strongly were very upset with what she had to say  well let me just tell you before we go any further in chicago which has the toughest gun laws in the united states probably you could say by far they have more gun violence than any other city so we have the toughest laws and you have tremendous gun violence i am a very strong supporter of the second amendment and i am  i dont know if hillary was saying it in a sarcastic manner but im very proud to have the endorsement of the nra and it the earliest endorsement theyve ever given to anybody who ran for president so im very honored by all of that we are going to appoint justices  this is the best way to help the second amendment we are going to appoint justices that will feel very strongly about the second amendment that will not do damage to the second amendment  right well if that would happen because i am prolife and i will be appointing prolife judges i would think that that will go back to the individual states  if they overturned it it will go back to the states  well if we put another two or perhaps three justice on that really what going to be  that will happen and thatll happen automatically in my opinion because i am putting prolife justices on the court i will say this it will go back to the states and the states will then make a determination  well i think it terrible if you go with what hillary is saying in the ninth month you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby now you can say that that ok and hillary can say that that ok but it not ok with me because based on what she saying and based on where she going and where she been you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day and that not acceptable  and honestly nobody has business doing what i just said doing that as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth nobody has that  well first of all she wants to give amnesty which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting on line for many many years we need strong borders in the audience tonight we have four mothers of  i mean these are unbelievable people that ive gotten to know over a period of years whose children have been killed brutally killed by people that came into the country illegally you have thousands of mothers and fathers and relatives all over the country theyre coming in illegally drugs are pouring in through the border we have no country if we have no border hillary wants to give amnesty she wants to have open borders the border  as you know the border patrol agents 16500plus ice last week endorsed me first time theyve ever endorsed a candidate it means their job is tougher but they know what going on they know it better than anybody they want strong borders they feel we have to have strong borders i was up in new hampshire the other day the biggest complaint they have  it with all of the problems going on in the world many of the problems caused by hillary clinton and by barack obama all of the problems  the single biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern border it just pouring and destroying their youth it poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people we have to have strong borders we have to keep the drugs out of our country we are  right now were getting the drugs theyre getting the cash we need strong borders we need absolute  we cannot give amnesty now i want to build the wall we need the wall and the border patrol ice they all want the wall we stop the drugs we shore up the border one of my first acts will be to get all of the drug lords all of the bad ones  we have some bad bad people in this country that have to go out were going to get them out were going to secure the border and once the border is secured at a later date well make a determination as to the rest but we have some bad hombres here and were going to get them out  chris i think it  i think i should respond to that first of all i had a very good meeting with the president of mexico very nice man we will be doing very much better with mexico on trade deals believe me the nafta deal signed by her husband is one of the worst deals ever made of any kind signed by anybody it a disaster hillary clinton wanted the wall hillary clinton fought for the wall in 2006 or thereabouts now she never gets anything done so naturally the wall wasnt built but hillary clinton wanted the wall  we are a country of laws we either have  and by the way well  well but she said one thing  and the wall president obama has moved millions of people out nobody knows about it nobody talks about it but under obama millions of people have been moved out of this country theyve been deported she doesnt want to say that but that what happened and that what happened big league as far as moving these people out and moving  we either have a country or we dont were a country of laws we either have a border or we dont now you can come back in and you can become a citizen but it very unfair we have millions of people that did it the right way theyre on line theyre waiting were going to speed up the process big league because it very inefficient but theyre on line and theyre waiting to become citizens very unfair that somebody runs across the border becomes a citizen under her plan you have open borders you would have a disaster on trade and you will have a disaster with your open borders  but what she doesnt say is that president obama has deported millions and millions of people just the way it is thank you that was a great pivot off the fact that she wants open borders ok how did we get on to putin  so just to finish on the borders she wants open borders people are going to pour into our country people are going to come in from syria she wants 550 percent more people than barack obama and he has thousands and thousands of people they have no idea where they come from and you see we are going to stop radical islamic terrorism in this country she wont even mention the words and neither will president obama so i just want to tell you she wants open borders now we can talk about putin i dont know putin he said nice things about me if we got along well that would be good if russia and the united states got along well and went after isis that would be good he has no respect for her he has no respect for our president and ill tell you what were in very serious trouble because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads  1800 by the way  where they expanded and we didnt 1800 nuclear warheads and she playing chicken look putin   from everything i see has no respect for this person  no puppet no puppet youre the puppet! no youre the puppet  she has no idea whether it russia china or anybody else  she has no idea hillary you have no idea  and our country has no idea yeah i doubt it i doubt it  she doesnt like putin because putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way excuse me putin has outsmarted her in syria he outsmarted her every step of the way yes that fine  by russia or anybody else of course i condemn of course i  i dont know putin i have no idea i never met putin this is not my best friend but if the united states got along with russia wouldnt be so bad let me tell you putin has outsmarted her and obama at every single step of the way whether it syria you name it missiles take a look at the start up that they signed the russians have said according to many many reports i cant believe they allowed us to do this they create warheads and we cant the russians cant believe it she has been outsmarted by putin and all you have to do is look at the middle east theyve taken over weve spent 6 trillion theyve taken over the middle east she has been outsmarted and outplayed worse than anybody ive ever seen in any government whatsoever  and she always will be wrong i have 200 generals  and admirals 21 endorsing me 21 congressional medal of honor recipients as far as japan and other countries we are being ripped off by everybody in the  were defending other countries we are spending a fortune doing it they have the bargain of the century all i said is we have to renegotiate these agreements because our country cannot afford to defend saudi arabia japan germany south korea and many other places we cannot continue to afford  she took that as saying nuclear weapons  look she been proven to be a liar on so many different ways this is just another lie  there no quote youre not going to find a quote from me and defend yourselves and defend yourselves i didnt say nuclear and defend yourself yes well first of all before i start on my plan her plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes her tax plan is a disaster and she can say all she wants about college tuition and im a big proponent were going to do a lot of things for college tuition but the rest of the public going to be paying for it we will have a massive massive tax increase under hillary clinton plan  but id like to start off where we left because when i said japan and germany and im  not to single them out but south korea these are very rich powerful countries saudi arabia nothing but money we protect saudi arabia why arent they paying she immediately  when she heard this i questioned it and i questioned nato why arent the nato questioned  why arent they paying because they werent paying since i did this  this was a year ago  all of a sudden theyre paying and ive been given a lot  a lot of credit for it all of a sudden theyre starting to pay up they have to pay up were protecting people they have to pay up and im a big fan of nato but they have to pay up she comes out and said we love our allies we think our allies are great well it awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are we have to tell japan in a very nice way we have to tell germany all of these countries south korea we have to say you have to help us out we have during his regime during president obama regime weve doubled our national debt were up to 20 trillion so my plan  were going to renegotiate trade deals were going to have a lot of free trade were going to have free trade more free trade than we have right now but we have horrible deals our jobs are being taken out by the deal that her husband signed nafta one of the worst deals ever our jobs are being sucked out of our economy you look at all of the places that i just left you go to pennsylvania you go to ohio you go to florida you go to any of them you go upstate new york our jobs have fled to mexico and other places were bringing our jobs back i am going to renegotiate nafta and if i cant make a great deal  then were going to terminate nafta and were going to create new deals were going to have trade but were going  were going to terminate it were going to make a great trade deal and if we cant were going to do it  were going to go a separate way because it has been a disaster we are going to cut taxes massively were going to cut business taxes massively theyre going to start hiring people were going to bring the 25 trillion   that offshore back into the country we are going to start the engine rolling again because   right now our country is dying at 1 percent gdp  you cant correct over a 10year period so i just left some high representatives of india theyre growing at 8 percent china is growing at 7 percent and that for them is a catastrophically low number we are growing  our last report came out  and it right around the 1 percent level and i think it going down last week as you know the end of last week they came out with an anemic jobs report a terrible jobs report in fact i said is that the last jobs report before the election because if it is i should win easily it was so bad the report was so bad look our country is stagnant weve lost our jobs weve lost our businesses were not making things anymore relatively speaking our product is pouring in from china pouring in from vietnam pouring in from all over the world ive visited so many communities this has been such an incredible education for me chris ive gotten to know so many  ive developed so many friends over the last year and they cry when they see what happened i pass factories that were thriving 20 25 years ago and because of the bill that her husband signed and she blessed 100 percent it is just horrible what happened to these people in these communities now she can say that her husband did well but boy did they suffer as nafta kicked in because it didnt really kick in very much but it kicked in after they left boy did they suffer that was one of the worst things that ever been signed by our country now she wants to sign transpacific partnership and she wants it she lied when she said she didnt call it the gold standard in one of the debates she totally lied she did call it the gold standard and they actually fact checked and they said i was right i was so honored  and that will be as bad as nafta well let me just say  let me just say  let me ask a simple question she been doing this for 30 years why the hell didnt you do it over the last 15 20 years  you were very much involved  excuse me my turn you were very much involved in every aspect of this country very much and you do have experience i say the one thing you have over me is experience but it bad experience because what youve done has turned out badly for 30 years youve been in a position to help and if you say that i use steel or i use something else i  make it impossible for me to do that i wouldnt mind the problem is you talk but you dont get anything done hillary you dont just like when you ran the state department 6 billion was missing how do you miss 6 billion you ran the state department 6 billion was either stolen they dont know it gone 6 billion if you become president this country is going to be in some mess believe me  give me a break well i think i did a much better job i built a massive company a great company some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world worth many many billions of dollars i started with a 1 million loan i agree with that it a 1 million loan but i built a phenomenal company and if we could run our country the way ive run my company we would have a country that you would be so proud of you would even be proud of it and frankly when you look at her real record take a look at syria take a look at the migration take a look at libya take a look at iraq she gave us isis because her and obama created this huge vacuum and a small group came out of that huge vacuum because when  we should never have been in iraq but once we were there we should have never got out the way they wanted to get out she gave us isis as sure as you are sitting there and what happened is now isis is in 32 countries and now i listen how she going to get rid of isis she going to get rid of nobody  well first of all those stories have been largely debunked those people  i dont know those people i have a feeling how they came i believe it was her campaign that did it just like if you look at what came out today on the clips where i was wondering what happened with my rally in chicago and other rallies where we had such violence she the one and obama that caused the violence they hired people  they paid them 1500 and theyre on tape saying be violent cause fights do bad things i would say the only way  because those stories are all totally false i have to say that and i didnt even apologize to my wife who sitting right here because i didnt do anything i didnt know any of these  i didnt see these women these women  the woman on the plane the  i think they want either fame or her campaign did it and i think it her campaign because what i saw what they did which is a criminal act by the way where theyre telling people to go out and start fistfights and start violence and ill tell you what in particular in chicago people were hurt and people could have been killed in that riot and that was now all on tape started by her i believe chris that she got these people to step forward if it wasnt they get their 10 minutes of fame but they were all totally  it was all fiction it was lies and it was fiction  i did not say that i did not say that i did not say that nobody has more respect for women than i do nobody nobody has more respect and frankly those stories have been largely debunked and i really want to just talk about something slightly different she mentions this which is all fiction all fictionalized probably or possibly started by her and her very sleazy campaign but i will tell you what isnt fictionalized are her emails where she destroyed 33000 emails criminally criminally after getting a subpoena from the united states congress what happened to the fbi i dont know we have a great general fourstar general today you read it in all of the papers going to potentially serve five years in jail for lying to the fbi one lie she lied hundreds of times to the people to congress and to the fbi he going to probably go to jail this is a fourstar general and she gets away with it and she can run for the presidency of the united states that really what you should be talking about not fiction where somebody wants fame or where they come out of her crooked campaign  wrong so sad when she talks about violence at my rallies and she caused the violence it on tape  the other things are false but honestly id love to talk about getting rid of isis and id love to talk about other things   but those other charges as she knows are false  i think that it been very well it been very well studied  and it a criminal enterprise and so many people know it  it a criminal enterprise saudi arabia giving 25 million qatar all of these countries you talk about women and women rights so these are people that push gays off business  off buildings these are people that kill women and treat women horribly and yet you take their money so id like to ask you right now why dont you give back the money that youve taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people so horribly why dont you give back the money i think it would be a great gesture because she takes a tremendous amount of money and you take a look at the people of haiti i was at a little haiti the other day in florida and i want to tell you they hate the clintons because what happened in haiti with the clinton foundation is a disgrace and you know it and they know it and everybody knows it  they dont want you to help them anymore id like to mention one thing trump foundation small foundation people contribute i contribute the money goes 100 percent  100 percent goes to different charities including a lot of military i dont get anything i dont buy boats i dont buy planes what happens  the money goes to them  no it was  we put up the american flag and that it they put up the american flag we fought for the right in palm beach to put up the american flag  there was there was and by the way   the money  the money went to fisher house where they build houses  the money that youre talking about went to fisher house where they build houses for veterans and disabled vets  so let me just tell you very quickly were entitled because of the laws that people like her passed to take massive amounts of depreciation on other charges and we do it and all of her donors  just about all of them  i know buffett took hundreds of millions of dollars soros george soros took hundreds of millions of dollars  let me just explain most of her donors have done the same thing as i do you know what she should have done and you know hillary what you should have done you should have changed the law when you were a united states senator   because your donors and your special interests are doing the same thing as i do except even more so  you should have changed the law but you wont change the law because you take in so much money i mean i sat in my apartment today on a very beautiful hotel down the street known as trump  but i will tell you i sat there  i sat there watching ad after ad after ad false ad all paid for by your friends on wall street that gave so much money because they know youre going to protect them and frankly you should have changed the laws  if you dont like what i did you should have changed the laws  i will look at it at the time im not looking at anything now ill look at it at the time what ive seen  what ive seen is so bad first of all the media is so dishonest and so corrupt and the pileon is so amazing the new york times actually wrote an article about it but they dont even care it so dishonest and theyve poisoned the mind of the voters but unfortunately for them i think the voters are seeing through it i think theyre going to see through it well find out on november 8th but i think theyre going to see through it  if you look  excuse me chris  if you look at your voter rolls you will see millions of people that are registered to vote  millions this isnt coming from me  this is coming from pew report and other places  millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldnt be registered to vote so let me just give you one other thing so i talk about the corrupt media i talk about the millions of people  tell you one other thing she shouldnt be allowed to run it crooked  she  she guilty of a very very serious crime she should not be allowed to run and just in that respect i say it rigged because she should never  chris she should never have been allowed to run for the presidency based on what she did with emails and so many other things  what im saying is that i will tell you at the time ill keep you in suspense ok should have gotten it i think what the fbi did and what the department of justice did including meeting with her husband the attorney general in the back of an airplane on the tarmac in arizona i think it disgraceful i think it a disgrace  i think weve never had a situation so bad in this country let me tell you mosul is so sad we had mosul but when she left when she took everybody out we lost mosul now were fighting again to get mosul the problem with mosul and what they wanted to do is they wanted to get the leaders of isis who they felt were in mosul about three months ago i started reading that they want to get the leaders and theyre going to attack mosul whatever happened to the element of surprise ok we announce were going after mosul i have been reading about going after mosul now for about  how long is it hillary three months these people have all left theyve all left the element of surprise douglas macarthur george patton spinning in their graves when they see the stupidity of our country so were now fighting for mosul that we had all she had to do was stay there and now were going in to get it but you know who the big winner in mosul is going to be after we eventually get it and the only reason they did it is because she running for the office of president and they want to look tough they want to look good he violated the red line in the sand and he made so many mistakes made all the mistakes that why we have the great migration but she wanted to look good for the election so theyre going in but who going to get mosul really well take mosul eventually but the way  if you look at what happening much tougher than they thought much much tougher much more dangerous going to be more deaths that they thought but the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because theyre smart they say what do we need this for so mosul is going to be a wonderful thing and iran should write us a letter of thank you just like the really stupid  the stupidest deal of all time a deal that going to give iran absolutely nuclear weapons iran should write us yet another letter saying thank you very much because iran as i said many years ago iran is taking over iraq something theyve wanted to do forever but weve made it so easy for them so were now going to take mosul and do you know who going to be the beneficiary iran oh yeah theyre making  i mean they are outsmarting  look youre not there you might be involved in that decision but you were there when you took everybody out of mosul and out of iraq you shouldnt have been in iraq but you did vote for it you shouldnt have been in iraq but once you were in iraq you should have never left the way  the point is the big winner is going to be iran  wrong wrong wrong chris we dont gain anything  iran is taking over iraq iran is taking over iraq we dont gain anything if they did it by surprise we could have gained if they did it by surprise no you are the one that unfit you know wikileaks just actually came out  john podesta said some horrible things about you and boy was he right he said some beauties and you know bernie sanders he said you have bad judgment you do and if you think that going into mosul after we let the world know were going in and all of the people that we really wanted  the leaders  theyre all gone if you think that was good then you do now john podesta said you have terrible instincts bernie sanders said you have bad judgment i agree with both  which is a big mistake it a catastrophe i mean  it a mess have you seen it have you seen it have you seen what happening to aleppo ok so it hasnt fallen take a look at it  that right and they are being slaughtered  because of bad decisions well aleppo is a disaster it a humanitarian nightmare but it has fallen from the  from any standpoint i mean what do you need a signed document take a look at aleppo it is so sad when you see what happened and a lot of this is because of hillary clinton because what happened is by fighting assad who turned out to be a lot tougher than she thought and now she going to say oh he loves assad she  he just much tougher and much smarter than her and obama and everyone thought he was gone two years ago three years ago he  he aligned with russia he now also aligned with iran who we made very powerful we gave them 150 billion back we give them 17 billion in cash i mean cash bundles of cash as big as this stage we gave them 17 billion now they have  he has aligned with russia and with iran they dont want isis but they have other things because were backing  were backing rebels we dont know who the rebels are were giving them lots of money lots of everything we dont know who the rebels are and when and if  and it not going to happen because you have russia and you have iran now but if they ever did overthrow assad you might end up with  as bad as assad is and he a bad guy but you may very well end up with worse than assad if she did nothing wed be in much better shape and this is what caused the great migration where she taking in tens of thousands of syrian refugees who probably in many cases  not probably who are definitely   in many cases isisaligned and we now have them in our country and wait until you see  this is going to be the great trojan horse and wait until you see what happens in the coming years lots of luck hillary thanks a lot for doing a great job  but i just have to it so ridiculous what she  she will defeat isis we should have never let isis happen in the first place and right now theyre in 32 countries  we should have  wait one second they had a ceasefire three weeks ago a ceasefire the united states russia and syria and during the ceasefire russia took over vast swatches of land and then they said we dont want the ceasefire anymore we are so outplayed on missiles on ceasefires they are outplayed now she wasnt there i assume she had nothing to do with it but our country is so outplayed by putin and assad and by the way  and by iran nobody can believe how stupid our leadership is  well i say theyre wrong because im going to create tremendous jobs and were bringing gdp from really 1 percent which is what it is now and if she got in it will be less than zero but were bringing it from 1 percent up to 4 percent and i actually think we can go higher than 4 percent i think you can go to 5 percent or 6 percent and if we do you dont have to bother asking your question because we have a tremendous machine we will have created a tremendous economic machine once again to do that were taking back jobs were not going to let our companies be raided by other countries where we lose all our jobs we dont make our product anymore it very sad but im going to create a  the kind of a country that we were from the standpoint of industry we used to be there weve given it up weve become very very sloppy weve had people that are political hacks making the biggest deals in the world bigger than companies you take these big companies these trade deals are far bigger than these companies and yet we dont use our great leaders many of whom back me and many of whom back hillary i must say but we dont use those people those are the people  these are the greatest negotiators in the world we have the greatest businesspeople in the world we have to use them to negotiate our trade deals we use political hacks we use people that get the position because they gave  they made a campaign contribution and theyre dealing with china and people that are very much smarter than they are so we have to use our great people but that being said we will create an economic machine the likes of which we havent seen in many decades and people chris will again go back to work and theyll make a lot of money and well have companies that will grow and expand and start from new  yeah yeah weve heard  weve heard this before hillary  weve heard this before thank you hillary could i just respond  because i did disagree with ronald reagan very strongly on trade i disagreed with him we should have been much tougher on trade even then ive been waiting for years nobody does it right and frankly now were going to do it right  im cutting taxes were going to grow the economy it going to grow at a record rate of growth no it going to totally help you and one thing we have to do repeal and replace the disaster known as obamacare it destroying our country it destroying our businesses our small business and our big businesses we have to repeal and replace obamacare you take a look at the kind of numbers that that will cost us in the year 17 it is a disaster if we dont repeal and replace  now it probably going to die of its own weight but obamacare has to go it  the premiums are going up 60 percent 70 percent 80 percent next year theyre going to go up over 100 percent and im really glad that the premiums have started  at least the people see what happening because she wants to keep obamacare and she wants to make it even worse and it cant get any worse bad health care at the most expensive price we have to repeal and replace obamacare  such a nasty woman your husband disagrees with you she raising the money from the people she wants to control doesnt work that way but when i started this campaign i started it very strongly it called make america great again were going to make america great we have a depleted military it has to be helped has to be fixed we have the greatest people on earth in our military we dont take care of our veterans we take care of illegal immigrants people that come into the country illegally better than we take care of our vets that cant happen our policemen and women are disrespected we need law and order but we need justice too our inner cities are a disaster you get shot walking to the store they have no education they have no jobs i will do more for africanamericans and latinos than she can ever do in 10 lifetimes all she done is talk to the africanamericans and to the latinos but they get the vote and then they come back they say well see you in four years we are going to make america strong again and we are going to make america great again and it has to start now we cannot take four more years of barack obama and that what you get when you get her
3,thank you for the opportunity to speak to you and thank you to the center for the national interest for honoring me with this invitationi would like to talk today about how to develop a new foreign policy direction for our country  one that replaces randomness with purpose ideology with strategy and chaos with peaceit is time to shake the rust off of america foreign policy it time to invite new voices and new visions into the foldthe direction i will outline today will also return us to a timeless principle my foreign policy will always put the interests of the american people and american security above all else that will be the foundation of every decision that i will makeamerica first will be the major and overriding theme of my administrationbut to chart our path forward we must first briefly look backwe have a lot to be proud of in the 1940s we saved the world the greatest generation beat back the nazis and the japanese imperialiststhen we saved the world again this time from totalitarian communism the cold war lasted for decades but we wondemocrats and republicans working together got mr gorbachev to heed the words of president reagan when he said tear down this wallhistory will not forget what we didunfortunately after the cold war our foreign policy veered badly off course we failed to develop a new vision for a new time in fact as time went on our foreign policy began to make less and less senselogic was replaced with foolishness and arrogance and this led to one foreign policy disaster after anotherwe went from mistakes in iraq to egypt to libya to president obama line in the sand in syria each of these actions have helped to throw the region into chaos and gave isis the space it needs to grow and prosperit all began with the dangerous idea that we could make western democracies out of countries that had no experience or interest in becoming a western democracywe tore up what institutions they had and then were surprised at what we unleashed civil war religious fanaticism thousands of american lives and many trillions of dollars were lost as a result the vacuum was created that isis would fill iran too would rush in and fill the void much to their unjust enrichmentour foreign policy is a complete and total disasterno vision no purpose no direction no strategytoday i want to identify five main weaknesses in our foreign policyfirst our resources are overextendedpresident obama has weakened our military by weakening our economy he crippled us with wasteful spending massive debt low growth a huge trade deficit and open bordersour manufacturing trade deficit with the world is now approaching 1 trillion a year were rebuilding other countries while weakening our ownending the theft of american jobs will give us the resources we need to rebuild our military and regain our financial independence and strengthi am the only person running for the presidency who understands this problem and knows how to fix itsecondly our allies are not paying their fair shareour allies must contribute toward the financial political and human costs of our tremendous security burden but many of them are simply not doing so they look at the united states as weak and forgiving and feel no obligation to honor their agreements with usin nato for instance only 4 of 28 other member countries besides america are spending the minimum required 2 of gdp on defensewe have spent trillions of dollars over time  on planes missiles ships equipment  building up our military to provide a strong defense for europe and asia the countries we are defending must pay for the cost of this defense  and if not the us must be prepared to let these countries defend themselvesthe whole world will be safer if our allies do their part to support our common defense and securitya trump administration will lead a free world that is properly armed and fundedthirdly our friends are beginning to think they cant depend on usweve had a president who dislikes our friends and bows to our enemieshe negotiated a disastrous deal with iran and then we watched them ignore its terms even before the ink was dryiran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon and under a trump administration will never be allowed to have a nuclear weaponall of this without even mentioning the humiliation of the united states with iran treatment of our ten captured sailorsin negotiation you must be willing to walk the iran deal like so many of our worst agreements is the result of not being willing to leave the table when the other side knows youre not going to walk it becomes absolutely impossible to winat the same time your friends need to know that you will stick by the agreements that you have with thempresident obama gutted our missile defense program then abandoned our missile defense plans with poland and the czech republiche supported the ouster of a friendly regime in egypt that had a longstanding peace treaty with israel  and then helped bring the muslim brotherhood to power in its placeisrael our great friend and the one true democracy in the middle east has been snubbed and criticized by an administration that lacks moral clarity just a few days ago vice president biden again criticized israel  a force for justice and peace  for acting as an impediment to peace in the regionpresident obama has not been a friend to israel he has treated iran with tender love and care and made it a great power in the middle east  all at the expense of israel our other allies in the region and critically the united statesweve picked fights with our oldest friends and now theyre starting to look elsewhere for helpfourth our rivals no longer respect usin fact they are just as confused as our allies but an even bigger problem is that they dont take us seriously any morewhen president obama landed in cuba on air force one no leader was there to meet or greet him  perhaps an incident without precedent in the long and prestigious history of air force onethen amazingly the same thing happened in saudi arabia  it called no respectdo you remember when the president made a long and expensive trip to copenhagen denmark to get the olympics for our country and after this unprecedented effort it was announced that the united states came in fourth placehe should have known the result before making such an embarrassing commitmentthe list of humiliations goes on and onpresident obama watches helplessly as north korea increases its aggression and expands even further with its nuclear reachour president has allowed china to continue its economic assault on american jobs and wealth refusing to enforce trade rules  or apply the leverage on china necessary to rein in north koreahe has even allowed china to steal government secrets with cyber attacks and engage in industrial espionage against the united states and its companiesweve let our rivals and challengers think they can get away with anythingif president obama goal had been to weaken america he could not have done a better jobfinally america no longer has a clear understanding of our foreign policy goalssince the end of the cold war and the breakup of the soviet union weve lacked a coherent foreign policyone day were bombing libya and getting rid of a dictator to foster democracy for civilians the next day we are watching the same civilians suffer while that country falls apartwere a humanitarian nation but the legacy of the obamaclinton interventions will be weakness confusion and disarraywe have made the middle east more unstable and chaotic than ever beforewe left christians subject to intense persecution and even genocideour actions in iraq libya and syria have helped unleash isisand were in a war against radical islam but president obama wont even name the enemy!hillary clinton also refuses to say the words radical islam even as she pushes for a massive increase in refugeesafter secretary clinton failed intervention in libya islamic terrorists in benghazi took down our consulate and killed our ambassador and three brave americans then instead of taking charge that night hillary clinton decided to go home and sleep! incredibleclinton blames it all on a video an excuse that was a total lie our ambassador was murdered and our secretary of state misled the nation  and by the way she was not awake to take that call at 3 oclock in the morningand now isis is making millions of dollars a week selling libyan oilthis will change when i am presidentto all our friends and allies i say america is going to be strong again america is going to be a reliable friend and ally againwere going to finally have a coherent foreign policy based upon american interests and the shared interests of our allieswe are getting out of the nationbuilding business and instead focusing on creating stability in the worldour moments of greatest strength came when politics ended at the water edgewe need a new rational american foreign policy informed by the best minds and supported by both parties as well as by our close alliesthis is how we won the cold war and it how we will win our new and future strugglesfirst we need a longterm plan to halt the spread and reach of radical islamcontaining the spread of radical islam must be a major foreign policy goal of the united statesevents may require the use of military force but it also a philosophical struggle like our long struggle in the cold warin this were going to be working very closely with our allies in the muslim world all of which are at risk from radical islamic violencewe should work together with any nation in the region that is threatened by the rise of radical islam but this has to be a twoway street  they must also be good to us and remember us and all we are doing for themthe struggle against radical islam also takes place in our homeland there are scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism for every case known to the public there are dozens morewe must stop importing extremism through senseless immigration policiesa pause for reassessment will help us to prevent the next san bernardino or worse  all you have to do is look at the world trade center and september 11thand then there isis i have a simple message for them their days are numbered i wont tell them where and i wont tell them how we must as a nation be more unpredictable but theyre going to be gone and soonsecondly we have to rebuild our military and our economythe russians and chinese have rapidly expanded their military capability but look what happened to us!our nuclear weapons arsenal  our ultimate deterrent  has been allowed to atrophy and is desperately in need of modernization and renewalour active duty armed forces have shrunk from 2 million in 1991 to about 13 million todaythe navy has shrunk from over 500 ships to 272 ships during that timethe air force is about 1/3 smaller than 1991 pilots are flying b52s in combat missions today which are older than most people in this roomand what are we doing about this president obama has proposed a 2017 defense budget that in real dollars cuts nearly 25 from what we were spending in 2011our military is depleted and were asking our generals and military leaders to worry about global warmingwe will spend what we need to rebuild our military it is the cheapest investment we can make we will develop build and purchase the best equipment known to mankind our military dominance must be unquestionedbut we will look for savings and spend our money wisely in this time of mounting debt not one dollar can be wastedwe are also going to have to change our trade immigration and economic policies to make our economy strong again  and to put americans first again this will ensure that our own workers right here in america get the jobs and higher pay that will grow our tax revenue and increase our economic might as a nationwe need to think smarter about areas where our technological superiority gives us an edge this includes 3d printing artificial intelligence and cyberwarfarea great country also takes care of its warriors our commitment to them is absolute a trump administration will give our service men and women the best equipment and support in the world when they serve and the best care in the world when they return as veterans to civilian lifefinally we must develop a foreign policy based on american interestsbusinesses do not succeed when they lose sight of their core interests and neither do countrieslook at what happened in the 1990s our embassies in kenya and tanzania were attacked and seventeen brave sailors were killed on the uss cole and what did we do it seemed we put more effort into adding china to the world trade organization  which has been a disaster for the united states  than into stopping al qaedawe even had an opportunity to take out osama bin laden and didnt do it and then we got hit at the world trade center and the pentagon the worst attack on our country in its historyour foreign policy goals must be based on america core national security interests and the following will be my prioritiesin the middle east our goals must be to defeat terrorists and promote regional stability not radical change we need to be clearsighted about the groups that will never be anything other than enemiesand we must only be generous to those that prove they are our friendswe desire to live peacefully and in friendship with russia and china we have serious differences with these two nations and must regard them with open eyes but we are not bound to be adversaries we should seek common ground based on shared interests russia for instance has also seen the horror of islamic terrorismi believe an easing of tensions and improved relations with russia  from a position of strength  is possible common sense says this cycle of hostility must end some say the russians wont be reasonable i intend to find out if we cant make a good deal for america then we will quickly walk from the tablefixing our relations with china is another important step towards a prosperous century china respects strength and by letting them take advantage of us economically we have lost all of their respect we have a massive trade deficit with china a deficit we must find a way quickly to balancea strong and smart america is an america that will find a better friend in china we can both benefit or we can both go our separate waysafter i am elected president i will also call for a summit with our nato allies and a separate summit with our asian allies in these summits we will not only discuss a rebalancing of financial commitments but take a fresh look at how we can adopt new strategies for tackling our common challengesfor instance we will discuss how we can upgrade nato outdated mission and structure  grown out of the cold war  to confront our shared challenges including migration and islamic terrorismi will not hesitate to deploy military force when there is no alternative but if america fights it must fight to win i will never send our finest into battle unless necessary  and will only do so if we have a plan for victoryour goal is peace and prosperity not war and destructionthe best way to achieve those goals is through a disciplined deliberate and consistent foreign policywith president obama and secretary clinton weve had the exact opposite a reckless rudderless and aimless foreign policy  one that has blazed a path of destruction in its wakeafter losing thousands of lives and spending trillions of dollars we are in far worse shape now in the middle east than ever beforei challenge anyone to explain the strategic foreign policy vision of obamaclinton  it has been a complete and total disasteri will also be prepared to deploy america economic resources financial leverage and sanctions can be very persuasive  but we need to use them selectively and with determination our power will be used if others do not play by the rulesour friends and enemies must know that if i draw a line in the sand i will enforce ithowever unlike other candidates for the presidency war and aggression will not be my first instinct you cannot have a foreign policy without diplomacy a superpower understands that caution and restraint are signs of strengthalthough not in government service i was totally against the war in iraq saying for many years that it would destabilize the middle east sadly i was correct and the biggest beneficiary was iran who is systematically taking over iraq and gaining access to their rich oil reserves  something it has wanted to do for decades and now to top it all off we have isismy goal is to establish a foreign policy that will endure for several generationsthat is why i will also look for talented experts with new approaches and practical ideas rather than surrounding myself with those who have perfect resumes but very little to brag about except responsibility for a long history of failed policies and continued losses at warfinally i will work with our allies to reinvigorate western values and institutions instead of trying to spread universal values that not everyone shares we should understand that strengthening and promoting western civilization and its accomplishments will do more to inspire positive reforms around the world than military interventionsthese are my goals as presidenti will seek a foreign policy that all americans whatever their party can support and which our friends and allies will respect and welcomethe world must know that we do not go abroad in search of enemies that we are always happy when old enemies become friends and when old friends become alliesto achieve these goals americans must have confidence in their country and its leadership againmany americans must wonder why our politicians seem more interested in defending the borders of foreign countries than their ownamericans must know that we are putting the american people first again on trade on immigration on foreign policy  the jobs incomes and security of the american worker will always be my first priorityno country has ever prospered that failed to put its own interests first both our friends and enemies put their countries above ours and we while being fair to them must do the samewe will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalismthe nationstate remains the true foundation for happiness and harmony i am skeptical of international unions that tie us up and bring america down and will never enter america into any agreement that reduces our ability to control our own affairsnafta as an example has been a total disaster for the us and has emptied our states of our manufacturing and our jobs never again only the reverse will happen we will keep our jobs and bring in new ones their will be consequences for companies that leave the us only to exploit it laterunder a trump administration no american citizen will ever again feel that their needs come second to the citizens of foreign countriesi will view the world through the clear lens of american interestsi will be america greatest defender and most loyal champion we will not apologize for becoming successful again but will instead embrace the unique heritage that makes us who we arethe world is most peaceful and most prosperous when america is strongestamerica will continually play the role of peacemakerwe will always help to save lives and indeed humanity itself but to play that role we must make america strong againwe must make america respected again and we must make america great againif we do that perhaps this century can be the most peaceful and prosperous the world has ever known thank you
4,good evening thank you very much i speak to you today as a lifelong supporter and true friend of israel im a newcomer to politics but not to backing the jewish statein 2001 weeks after the attacks on new york city and on washington and frankly the attacks on all of us attacks that perpetrated and they were perpetrated by the islamic fundamentalists mayor rudy giuliani visited israel to show solidarity with terror victims i sent my plane because i backed the mission for israel 100 percentin spring of 2004 at the height of the violence in the gaza strip i was the grand marshal of the 40th salute to israel parade the largest single gathering in support of the jewish state it was a very dangerous time for israel and frankly for anyone supporting israel many people turned down this honor i did not i took the risk and im glad i didbut i didnt come here tonight to pander to you about israel that what politicians do all talk no action believe me i came here to speak to you about where i stand on the future of american relations with our strategic ally our unbreakable friendship and our cultural brother the only democracy in the middle east the state of israelthank you my number one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with iran thank you i have been in business a long time i know deal making and let me tell you this deal is catastrophic for america for israel and for the whole of the middle eastthe problem here is fundamental weve rewarded the world leading state sponsor of terror with 150 billion dollars and we received absolutely nothing in return ive studied this issue in great detail i would say actually greater by far than anybody else believe me oh believe meand it a bad deal the biggest concern with the deal is not necessarily that iran is going to violate it because already as you know it has the bigger problem is that they can keep the terms and still get the bomb by simply running out the clock and of course theyll keep the billions and billions of dollars that we so stupidly and foolishly gave themthe deal doesnt even require iran to dismantle its military nuclear capability yes it places limits on its military nuclear program for only a certain number of years but when those restrictions expire iran will have an industrialsized military nuclear capability ready to go and with zero provision for delay no matter how bad iran behavior is terrible terrible situation that we are all placed in and especially israelwhen im president i will adopt a strategy that focuses on three things when it comes to iran first we will stand up to iran aggressive push to destabilize and dominate the regioniran is a very big problem and will continue to be but if im not elected president i know how to deal with trouble and believe me that why im going to be elected president folks and we are leading in every poll remember that pleaseiran is a problem in iraq a problem in syria a problem in lebanon a problem in yemen and will be a very very major problem for saudi arabia literally every day iran provides more and better weapons to support their puppet states hezbollah lebanon received and ill tell you what it has received sophisticated antiship weapons antiaircraft weapons and gps systems and rockets like very few people anywhere in the world and certainly very few countries havenow theyre in syria trying to establish another front against israel from the syrian side of the golan heights in gaza iran is supporting hamas and islamic jihad and in the west bank theyre openly offering palestinians 7000 dollars per terror attack and 30000 dollars for every palestinian terrorist home that been destroyed a deplorable deplorable situationiran is financing military forces throughout the middle east and it absolutely incredible that we handed them over 150 billion dollars to do even more toward the many horrible acts of terrorsecondly we will totally dismantle iran global terror network which is big and powerful but not powerful like usiran has seeded terror groups all over the world during the last five years iran has perpetuated terror attacks in 25 different countries on five continents theyve got terror cells everywhere including in the western hemisphere very close to home iran is the biggest sponsor of terrorism around the world and we will work to dismantle that reach believe me believe methird at the very least we must enforce the terms of the previous deal to hold iran totally accountable and we will enforce it like youve never seen a contract enforced before folks believe meiran has already since the deal is in place testfired ballistic missiles three times those ballistic missiles with a range of 1250 miles were designed to intimidate not only israel which is only 600 miles away but also intended to frighten europe and someday maybe hit even the united states and were not going to let that happen were not letting it happen and were not letting it happen to israel believe methank you do you want to hear something really shocking as many of the great people in this room know painted on those missiles in both hebrew and farsi were the words israel must be wiped off the face of the earth you can forget thatwhat kind of demented minds write that in hebrew and here another you talk about twisted here another twisted part testing these missiles does not even violate the horrible deal that weve made the deal is silent on test missiles but those tests do violate the united nations security council resolutions the problem is no one has done anything about it we will i promise we willthank you which brings me to my next point the utter weakness and incompetence of the united nations the united nations is not a friend of democracy it not a friend to freedom it not a friend even to the united states of america whereas you know it has its home and it surely is not a friend to israelwith president obama in his final year yay he may be the worst thing to ever happen to israel believe me believe me and you know it better than anybody so with the president in his final year discussions have been swirling about an attempt to bring a security council resolution on terms of an eventual agreement between israel and palestine let me be clear an agreement imposed by the united nations would be a total and complete disasterthe united states must oppose this resolution and use the power of our veto which i will use as president 100 percentwhen people ask why it because that not how you make a deal deals are made when parties come together they come to a table and they negotiate each side must give up something its values i mean we have to do something where there value in exchange for something that it requires that what a deal isa deal is really something that when we impose it on israel and palestine we bring together a group of people that come up with something that not going to happen with the united nations it will only further very importantly it will only further delegitimize israel it will be a catastrophe and a disaster for israel it not going to happen folksand further it would reward palestinian terrorism because every day theyre stabbing israelis and even americans just last week american taylor allen force a west point grad phenomenal young person who served in iraq and afghanistan was murdered in the street by a knifewielding palestinian you dont reward behavior like that you cannot do it there only one way you treat that kind of behavior you have to confront itso it not up to the united nations to really go with a solution it really the parties that must negotiate a resolution themselves they have no choice they have to do it themselves or it will never hold up anyway the united states can be useful as a facilitator of negotiations but no one should be telling israel that it must abide by some agreement made by others thousands of miles away that dont even really know what happening to israel to anything in the area it so preposterous were not going to let that happenwhen im president believe me i will veto any attempt by the un to impose its will on the jewish state it will be vetoed 100 percentyou see i know about deal making that what i do i wrote the art of the deal one of the bestselling alltime and i mean seriously im saying one of because ill be criticized if i say the so im going to be very diplomatic one of ill be criticized i think it isnumber one but why take a chance one of the alltime bestselling books about deals and deal makingto make a great deal you need two willing participants we know israel is willing to deal israel has been tryingthat right israel has been trying to sit down at the negotiating table without preconditions for years you had camp david in 2000 where prime minister barak made an incredible offer maybe even too generous arafat rejected it in 2008 prime minister olmert made an equally generous offer the palestinian authority rejected it alsothen john kerry tried to come up with the framework and abbas didnt even respond not even to the secretary of state of the united states of america they didnt even respond when i become president the days of treating israel like a secondclass citizen will end on day onethank you and when i say something i mean iti will meet with prime minister netanyahu immediately i have known him for many years and well be able to work closely together to help bring stability and peace to israel and to the entire region meanwhile every single day you have rampant incitement and children being taught to hate israel and to hate the jews it has to stopwhen you live in a society where the firefighters are the heroes little kids want to be firefighters when you live in a society where athletes and movie stars are the heroes little kids want to be athletes and movie stars in palestinian society the heroes are those who murder jews we cant let this continue we cant let this happen any longeryou cannot achieve peace if terrorists are treated as martyrs glorifying terrorists is a tremendous barrier to peace it is a horrible way to think it a barrier that cant be broken that will end and itll end soon believe me in palestinian textbooks and mosques youve got a culture of hatred that has been fomenting there for years and if we want to achieve peace theyve got to go out and theyve got to start [sic] this educational process they have to end education of hatred they have to end it and nowthere is no moral equivalency israel does not name public squares after terrorists israel does not pay its children to stab random palestinians you see what president obama gets wrong about deal making is that he constantly applies pressure to our friends and rewards our enemiesand you see that happening all the time that pattern practiced by the president and his administration including former secretary of state hillary clinton who is a total disaster by the way she and president obama have treated israel very very badlybut it repeated itself over and over again and it done nothing to embolden those who hate america we saw that with releasing the 150 billion dollars to iran in the hope that they would magically join the world community it didnt happenpresident obama thinks that applying pressure to israel will force the issue but it precisely the opposite that happens already half of the population of palestine has been taken over by the palestinian isis in hamas and the other half refuses to confront the first half so it a very difficult situation that never going to get solved unless you have great leadership right here in the united states well get it solved one way or the other we will get it solvedbut when the united states stands with israel the chances of peace really rise and rises exponentially that what will happen when donald trump is president of the united stateswe will move the american embassy to the eternal capital of the jewish people jerusalem and we will send a clear signal that there is no daylight between america and our most reliable ally the state of israelthe palestinians must come to the table knowing that the bond between the united states and israel is absolutely totally unbreakable they must come to the table willing and able to stop the terror being committed on a daily basis against israel they must do thatand they must come to the table willing to accept that israel is a jewish state and it will forever exist as a jewish statei love the people in this room i love israel i love israel ive been with israel so long in terms of ive received some of my greatest honors from israel my father before me incredible my daughter ivanka is about to have a beautiful jewish baby in fact it could be happening right now which would be very nice as far as im concernedso i want to thank you very much this has been a truly great honor thank you everybody thank you thank you very much

6,thank you i want to applaud my daughter ivanka for her work and leadership on the issues facing working moms in our country she has been deeply invested in this since long before the campaign began and i am so grateful for her work and efforts on this proposal which i will be outlining todayi want to also take a moment to recognize congresswoman cathy mcmorris rodgers chairwoman of the house republican conference and a mother of three small children who has been such a leader on these issueswe are also joined tonight by some amazing members of congress in our  congresswoman blackburn lummis black and ellmersour campaign is about ideas were about solutions ive travelled all over the country in recent weeks offering detailed plans to make life better for you and your familyive outlined detailed proposals for providing school choice reforming our tax and regulatory code lifting restrictions on american energy rebuilding our military changing our foreign policy fixing our immigration policy and keeping our country saferight now our politicians have locked our country into endless fights about small and petty things im asking the nation to lift our sights and to imagine what we can accomplish if we work together trust each other and put the needs of our own citizens firstwe must break our ties with the failed and bitter politics of the past and pursue a future where every american is honored and respectedwe have to reject the arrogance of washington dc that looks down on everyday hardworking people too often those who have power have disdain for the views beliefs and attitudes of those who dont have political powerthose in leadership must put themselves in the shoes of the laidoff factory worker the family worried about security or the mom struggling to afford childcarethat means we need working mothers to be fairly compensated for their work and to have access to affordable quality child care for their kidswe want higher pay better wages and a growing economy for everyonethese solutions must update laws passed more than half a century ago when most women were still not in the labor force today nearly 2 in 3 mothers with young children have jobsfor many families in our country childcare is now the single largest expense  even more than housingyet very little meaningful policy work has been done in this area  and my opponent has no childcare planmany americans are just one crisis away from disaster  a sick kid a lost job a damaged home there is no financial securitybut that will all change under our profamily prochild proworker plans i am outlining tonight before going any further i want everyone watching on tv right now to go to donaldjtrumpcom to read the full planthe first part of my childcare plan allows every parent or family in america  including adoptive parents and foster parent guardians  to deduct their childcare expenses from their income taxesthey will be able to fully deduct the average cost of child care for their state from birth through the age of 13because of the way the benefit is capped and structured our plan will bring relief to working and middle class familiesthe deduction also applies to elder care capped at a 5000dollar deduction per yearimportantly our policy also supports mothers who choose to stay at home and honors and recognizes their incredible contributionsto their families and to our society families with a stayathome parent will be able to fully deduct the average cost of child care from their taxesfor lowincome individuals who have no net income tax liability we will offer an expanded earned income tax credit eitc in the form of a childcare rebate working parents can get an expanded eitc benefit that equals up to half of their total payroll tax  a major relief for lowincome parents this translates to as much as an extra 1200 dollars in eitc benefits for working familiesnext our plan allows every parent in america to open up a dependent care savings account families can contribute up to 2000 dollars a year to these accounts completely taxfree crucially unlike the flexible spending accounts that exist today these accounts will be available to all americans  you wont have to depend on your employer to provide themimmediate family and employers can also contribute to a dependent account each of which is designated for a specific child including an unborn childthe money that is put into these accounts can also be spent not only on child care but also child enrichment activities additionally the funds in these accounts do not expire at the end of the year  they dont revert to employers or to the treasury instead the funds rollover  so while only 2000 dollars can be contributed each year unspent sums can accumulate and create substantial savingsthese savings can then be used by parents to help give their kids school choice and will thus contribute to the school choice reformsi outlined last weekthe funds will remain in the account until the age of 18 whatever still remains at that time can be used to help offset the costs of higher educationfor lowincome individuals the federal government will provide matching funds  if parents contribute 1000 dollars the federal government will provide a 500 dollars match to help lowincome families reach these targets and save money we will put a box on federal income tax forms allowing these parents to have their earned income tax credit funds directly deposited into their dependent care savings accountsthese dependent care savings accounts can also be setup to provide care for elderly dependentsour plan also includes much needed regulatory reform to incentivize private sector solutions the new funds offered by our plan will create a new market for innovative childcare solutionsbut to make sure these solutions are available especially in lowincome and rural communities we must reduce regulations that favor large institutional care facilities we will allow the states to make the decisions that are right for themin this era of the sharing economy we want parents to be able to access lowercost competitive and innovative solutions at the click of a button  including services like nannysharing our plan would also cover care provided by relatives and grandparentsour plan includes incentives for more employers to offer onsite childcare as well this can often be a good solution for many working parents and can save them up to 30 minutes of commute time currently only 7 of employers provide these services our plan will expand tax deductions for employers allow companies to pool resources to provide shared childcare services and remove needless requirements that have prevented employers from using the creditfinally our plan offers a crucial safety net for working mothers whose employers do not provide paid maternity leave this solution will receive strong bipartisan support and will be completely selffinancing by recapturing fraud and improper payments in the unemployment insurance program we can provide 6 weeks of paidmaternity leave to any mother with a newborn child whose employer does not provide the benefit this maternity leave will be paid straight out of the unemployment insurance fund and again this safety net will be completely paidfor through savings within the programthere are more reforms and solutions in our childcare plan and you can review them all on the websiteon thursday i will outline my full economic plan which is completely paid for through economic growth and proposed federal budget savings together our tax trade regulatory and energy policies will add trillions in new deficitlowering growththese are the kinds of solutions i want to bring to the white house as your president it time to free ourselves from the baskets that politicians try to put us in and instead to work together  not as republicans or democrats  but as americans to achieve real positive results for the american peoplewhile my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable i call you hardworking american patriots who love your country loveyour families and want a better future for all americansit time to end the rule of special interests and to begin the rule of the american peopleit time to stop fighting over the smallest words and to start dreaming about the great adventures that lie aheadit is time to believe in americatogether we will make our country strong againwe will make our country prosperous againand will make our country great again for everyone

for more than half a million criminal offenses including 1055 homicides 5516 sexual assault charges and more than 50000 charges of either burglary or theftyet hillary clinton wants a totally completely open bordershe wants catchandreleaseobamacare for illegal immigrantsmassive amnesty in her first 100 daysshe wants to gut immigration enforcementshe supports sanctuary citiesshe wants to let people overstay their visas without removalone lawless order after anotherwe must not let it happenhillary clinton also wants a 550 increase in syrian refugees there have been hundreds of immigrants and their children charged with terrorism inside the united states since 9/11 and a number of terrible attacks like the boston bombing san bernardino and orlando yet hillary clinton wants to fling open the floodgates even wideri want to create safe zones in the middle east my plan suspends visas when we cant perform effective screening and it puts forward a new ideological screening program to keep out people from our country who dont support our values after all that is what taking the oath of citizenship is all aboutthis election will decide whether or not we have a borderthis election will decide whether or not we have a countrytoday i met with the moms of american children killed by illegal immigrants as a result of the policies hillary clinton supports hillary clinton will never meet with these families she will never hear these storiesthese are all forgotten americans  they are not hollywood or media stars or big money special interest donorsshe is boughtandpaidfor by the special intereststhis corruption relates closely to another corruption scandal that strikes at the heart of our democracy every day more and more alarming facts come outthe scandal i speak of is the state department payforplay scandal under hillary clintonif our secretary of state can be bought or bribed or sell or trade government favors then the whole american system is threatenedit is a threat to the foundation of democracy itself this is what happens in a third world country  it the failed conditions people flee when they come to americaamerica can never elect a candidate who like hillary clinton did government favors for those giving her family and her foundation massive amounts of cashthe new revelations about hillary clinton email scandal make clear we have only seen the tip of the iceberghillary clinton is desperate to coverup her crimes that why she deleted 33000 emails that also why she lied repeatedly to congress and the american publicshe said she never sent or received classified materialsthat was a lie proved over and over againshe claimed she used an insecure email server for the convenience of using only one device but she used multiple devicesanother lieunder penalty of perjury she said she turned over all of her workrelated emails but the fbi found thousands she never turned over and now just found another 15000 moreanother clinton lieshe said she sent nothing marked classifieda total lie unmasked to the world and more to comeshe said her server was secure and had no breaches but we know now it was completely unsecure and the fbi director said it could easily be hacked by our foreign enemiesmore clinton liesclinton said her lawyers reviewed all of her emails before destroying themone more hillary clinton lielie after lie after liehillary clinton is unfit to hold public officeit is impossible to figure out where the clinton foundation ends and the state department begins it is now abundantly clear that the clintons set up a business to profit from public office they sold access and specific actions by and to them for moneyit goes back to the arkansas days and it continued during the white house days with the sale of the lincoln bedroom to large donorsbut once bill was out of office the small time clinton business  or more accurately their crime enterprise  grew with the roles reversed bill now an expresident collected the money for the clinton foundation and hillary clinton had the public offices to sell senator secretary of state and for all that time a potential president they turned this into an exponentially larger businessbut it was more than a business it was a continuing big time criminal enterprise it involved numerous violations of the conflict of interest and bribery laws and other serious laws of the united statesthe emails and phone logs show that the clinton foundation and the clinton department of state were one and the same if you donated to the clinton foundation or paid massive speaking fees to bill clinton you got an entry to the department of state together they constituted the most scandalous and certainly most profitable sale of public office since the teapot dome scandal of the 1920stoday a phone log was released for cheryl mills she was secretary of state clinton chief of staff you would expect the log to contain only calls concerning department of state business but cheryl mills received 148 messages between 2010 and 2012 from the chief operating officer of the clinton foundation  no other individual or group appears to have left that many messageswe also just learned today that more than half the people who met with hillary clinton from outside government while she was secretary of state were donors to the foundationthis creates the nexus which is at the core of a rico case in other words they merged the two into the clinton family racketeering enterprisethe specific crimes committed to carry out that enterprise are too numerous to cover in this speech i walked through two of them yesterday  the sale of us uranium to russia and the exemption of a telecom giant from sanctions after they paid bill clinton for a speechthe ubs saga is another one shortly after hillary clinton became secretary of state she went to geneva and intervened in a dispute concerning secret identities of americansshe negotiated a very good deal for ubs and a very bad deal for law enforcement of the 52000 accounts the us was seeking the government settled for only 4450 accounts her intervention was described by treasury as unusualbefore her unusual intervention ubs had donated only 60000 to the foundation after the clinton favor for ubs it opened its wallet for big bucks and out came a 600000 contribution a 32 million loan and a 15 million speaking fee for bill clintonthis is corruption pure and simplethis is why i have called for a special prosecutorjustice is supposed to be blind it never supposed to be for salein the longrun there is only one way to end the corruption in our country elect donald j trumphillary clinton thinks she is above the law come november the american people will show her that she is notyou will be voting for justice fairness and equalityyou will also be voting for a more inclusive country where no one is left outanother 2 million latinos have joined the ranks of those in poverty incomes for latino households have declined by nearly 1000 under president obama the number of latino children living in poverty increased by 15 percentour progrowth projobs profamily agenda is going to bring hope back to every community in our nation i will dedicate myself to restore the ladder of success to all those who live in povertywe reject the bigotry of hillary clinton who sees communities of color only as votes not as human beings worthy of a better futurethe era of division is coming to end we will create a new future of american unityare you ready for real american changeit is time to emphasize what we all have in common as americanswe will promote our common culture values and principleswe will be one nationwe will be one peoplewe will share together one great futureit going to be america

men and women in uniformall across this country ive met so many incredible members of both our military and law enforcement community there nothing ive enjoyed more than the time ive spent with our service members police officers and also our firefighters and paramedicsthey embody the goodness and decency of our countryi was thus deeply shocked and alarmed this friday to hear my opponent attack slander smear and demean these wonderful amazing people who are supporting our campaignour support comes from every part of america and every walk of life we have the support of cops and soldiers carpenters and welders the young and the old and millions of working class families who just want a better futurethese were the people hillary clinton so viciously demonized these were among the countless americans that hillary clinton called deplorable irredeemable and unamerican she called these patriotic men and women every vile name in the book  she called them racist sexist xenophobic and islamaphobicshe called them a basket of deplorables in both a speech and an interview she divides people into baskets as though they were objects not human beingshillary clinton made these comments at one of her highdollar fundraisers in wall streetshe and her wealthy donors all had a good laugh they were laughing at the very people who pave the roads she drives on paint the buildings she speaks in and keep the lights on in her auditoriumhillary clinton is an insider supported by powerful insiders attacking americans who have no political powerhillary clinton spoke with hatred and derision for the people who make this country runshe spoke with contempt for the people who thanklessly follow the rules pay their taxes and scratch out a living for their familieswhile hillary clinton lives a sequestered life behind gates and walls and guards she mocks and demeans hardworking americans who only want their own families to enjoy a fraction of the security enjoyed by our politiciansafter months of hiding from the press hillary clinton has revealed her true thoughtsshe revealed herself to be a person who looks down on the proud citizens of our country as subjects for her to rule overher comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as secretary of state hide and delete her emails put classified information in the reach of our enemies lie to congress and sell government favors and access through her foundationit the same attitude that explains why hillary clinton refuses to take accountability for the deadly disasters she helped to create in iraq in syria and in libyato this day she still wont take accountability for her role in unleashing isis across the middle east  or for putting iran on the path to a nuclear weaponhillary clinton believes she is above the law that she is above accountability and that she is above each and every one of youour campaign is about giving voice to the voiceless it about representing the forgotten men and women of this countryim here to represent everyone but especially those who are struggling against injustice and unfairnessi am running so that the powerful can no longer beat up on the powerless im running to take on the special interests the big donors and the corrupt political insidersi am running to be your voicehillary clinton is a voice for wall street for hedge fund managers for the top tenth of the one percent just look at the people funding hillary clinton campaign and paying for her speeches and youll know who she representsthe disdain that hillary clinton expressed towards millions of decent americans disqualifies her from public serviceyou cannot run for president if you have such contempt in your heart for the american voter you cant lead this nation if you have such a low opinion of its citizenshillary clinton still hasnt apologized to those she slandered in fact she hasnt backed down at all  she doubleddown on her campaign of conspiracy and contemptif hillary clinton will not retract her comments in full then i dont see how she can credibly campaignlet be clear these were not offhand comments from hillary clinton these were not stray remarks in an interview or an accidental choice of words these were lengthy planned and prepared remarks  it was perhaps the most explicit attack on the american voter ever spoken by a majorparty presidential nomineeclinton was using a very deliberate page from the democratic playbook  smearing someone with one of those names in order to scare them out of voting for change she just took it to a whole new level by applying it to tens of millions of peopleshe used these vile words in order to bully and intimidate honest citizens out of seeking government reformpeople who want their immigration laws enforced and their borders secured are not racists they are patriotic americans of all backgrounds who want their jobs and families protectedpeople who warn about radical islamic terrorism are not islamophobes they are decent american citizens who want to uphold our tolerant values and keep our country safepeople who support the police and who want crime reduced are not prejudiced they are concerned and loving citizens whose hearts break every time an innocent child is lost to preventable violencehillary clinton doesnt have to worry about

clintons are laughing at them the director performance in congress coupled with bill clinton clandestine meeting on the tarmac in the attorney general airplane just prior to decisiontime on hillary  supposedly talking about golf and grandchildren  is perhaps the lowest point in those department historyinstead of being held accountable hillary is running for president in what looks like a rigged election the election is being rigged by corrupt media pushing completely false allegations and outright lies in an effort to elect her presidentbut we are going to stop it we are not going to back down we are not going to let it happen we are just getting startedamericans have had it with the years the decades of clinton corruption they get rich stealing your jobs and shipping them to other countriesthis will finally be the year the american people say enough is enoughspeaking in secret to a foreign bank hillary clinton said her dream is for totally open trade and open bordersby open trade she means foreign countries can cheat us out of millions of jobs and trillions of dollarsby open borders she means totally unlimited immigrationwhen she thought no one was listening hillary clinton was plotting to destroy the sovereignty of the united stateseither we win the election or we lose the countrya trump administration will secure and defend our borders and yes we will build a walla wall will not only keep out dangerous cartels and criminals but it will also keep out the drugs and heroin poisoning our youthwhen i won the new hampshire primary i promised the people of new hampshire that i would stop drugs from pouring into your communities i am now doublingdown on that promise and can guarantee you  we will not only stop the drugs from pouring in but we will help all of those people so seriously addicted get the assistance they need to unchain themselvesnew hampshire has one of the highest drug overdose death rates in the countrywe have to solve this crisisi have to give credit to my running mate mike pence on this issuemike increased the mandatory minimum sentences for the most serious drug offenders while expanding access to treatment and prevention options for those struggling with addictionwe must make similar efforts a priority for the nationnot too long ago we read about christopher honor and courtney griffin  a young rockingham county couple who died of an overdose within a year of each other their story of prescription drugs heroin wait times for treatment and missed opportunity in the court system are a tragic reminder of why we need a plan to end the opioid epidemicfirst we will stop the flow of illegal drugs into the countrythe number of heroin seizures on the border has tripled since 2008ive received the firstever endorsement of our border patrol and ice officers and under a trump administration we will work with them to end the flow of drugs across our border for goodwe are also going to put an end to sanctuary cities which refuse to turn over illegal immigrant drug traffickers for deportationwe will dismantle the illegal immigrant cartels and violent gangs and we will send them swiftly out of our countrywe will aggressively prosecute traffickers of illegal drugs and provide law enforcement and prosecutors with the resources and support they need to do their jobspresident obama has commuted the sentences of record numbers of high level drug traffickers many of them kingpins and violent armed traffickers with extensive criminal histories hillary clinton promises to continue and expand this approach turning our streets back over to gangs drug cartels and armed career criminalsover the last few years this administration has been steadily dismantling the federal criminal justice system tens of thousands of drug dealers have been released from prison early including many illegal immigrantsregardless of their history of violence or ties to transnational gangs and cartelssecond we will close the shipping loopholes that china and others are exploiting to send dangerous drugs across our borders in the hands of our own postal servicethese traffickers use loopholes in the postal service to mail fentanyl and other drugs to users and dealers in the usa trump administration will crack down on this abuse and give law enforcement the tools they need to accomplish this missionthird we will fix the misguided rules and regulations that have made this problem worseit is tragedy enough that so many americans are struggling with lifethreatening addiction we should not compound that tragedy with government policies and bureaucratic rules that make it even harder for them to get helpthe fda has been far too slow to approve abusedeterring drugs and when the fda has approved these medications the rules have been far too restrictive severely limiting the number of authorized prescribers as well as the number of patients each doctor can treatrecovery medications have the potential to save thousands and thousands of lives we prescribe opioids like oxycontin freely but when patients become addicted to those drugs we stop doctors from giving patients the treatments they medically needas president id work to lift the cap on the number of patients that doctors can treat provided they follow safe prescribing practices and proper treatment supervisionat the same time dea should reduce the amount of schedule ii opioids drugs like oxycodone methadone and fentanyl that can be made and sold in the us we have 5 percent of the world population but use 80 percent of the prescription opioidsfinally we will give people struggling with addiction access to the help they needcongress has already taken the first step by passing the comprehensive addiction and recovery act this legislation is an important stepi would also expand incentives for states and local governments to use drug courts and mandated treatment these can be a cost effective appropriate and humane response to addictioni would dramatically expand access to treatment slots and end medicaid policies that obstruct inpatient treatmenti would dramatically expand first responders and caregivers access to narcan an antidote that treats overdoses and saves thousands of livesi would also restore accountability to our veterans administration too many of our brave veterans have been prescribed these dangerous and addictive drugs by a va that should have been paying them better attentiontogether these steps will ensure that every american struggling with addiction has access to the care and the help that he or she needsbut if we are going to bring hope back to our communities we not only have to solve our drug crisis but our economic crisisthe wealth has been raided from our country leaving behind dilapidated communities rusted out factories and shattered dreamsat the center of our economic revival will be fixing our terrible trade deals47 million americans are in poverty and 45 million

campaign  nobody else ismy only interest is the american peopleso while sometimes i can be too honest hillary clinton is the exact opposite she never tells the truth one lie after another and getting worse each passing daythe american people are still waiting for hillary clinton to apologize for all of the many lies she told to them and the many times she betrayed themtell me has hillary clinton ever apologized for lying about her illegal email server and deleting 33000 emailshas hillary clinton apologized for turning the state department into a payforplay operation where favors are sold to the highest bidderhas she apologized for lying to the families who lost loved ones at benghazihas she apologized for putting iran on the path to nuclear weaponshas she apologized for iraq for libya for syria has she apologized for unleashing isis across the worldhas hillary clinton apologized for the decisions she made that have led to so much death destruction and terrorismspeaking of lies we now know from the state department announcement that president obama lied about the 400 million dollars in cash that was flown to iran he denied it was for the hostages but it was he said we dont pay ransom but he did he lied about the hostages  openly and blatantly  just like he lied about obamacarenow the administration has put every american travelling overseas including our military personnel at greater risk of being kidnapped hillary clinton owns president obama iran policy one more reason she can never be allowed to be presidentlet talk about the economy here in this beautiful state so many people have suffered because of nafta bill clinton signed the deal and hillary clinton supported it north carolina has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since nafta went into effectbill clinton also put china into the world trade organization  another hillary clintonbacked deal your city of charlotte has lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since china joined the wto and many of these jobs were lost while hillary clinton was secretary of state  our chief diplomat with china she was a disaster totally unfit for the jobhillary clinton owes the state of north carolina a very big apology and i think youll get that apology around the same time youll get to see her 33000 deleted emailsanother major issue in this campaign has been the border our open border has allowed drugs and crime and gangs to pour into our communities so much needless suffering so much preventable death ive spent time with the families of wonderful americans whose loved ones were killed by the open borders and sanctuary cities that hillary clinton supportsive embraced the crying parents whove lost their children to violence spilling across our border parents like laura wilkerson and michelle root and sabine durden and jamiel shaw whose children were killed by illegal immigrantsmy opponent supports sanctuary citiesbut where was the sanctuary for kate steinle where was the sanctuary for the children of laura michelle sabine and jamielwhere was the sanctuary for every other parent who has suffered so horriblythese moms and dads dont get a lot of consideration from our politicians they certainly dont get apologies theyll never even get the time of day from hillary clintonbut they will always come first to melisten closely we will deliver justice for all of these american families we will create a system of immigration that makes us all proudhillary clinton mistakes destroy innocent lives sacrifice national security and betray the working families of this countryplease remember this i will never put personal profit before national security i will never leave our border open to appease donors and special interests i will never support a trade deal that kills american jobs i will never put the special interests before the national interest i will never put a donor before a voter or a lobbyist before a citizeninstead i will be a champion for the peoplethe establishment media doesnt cover what really matters in this country or what really going on in people lives they will take words of mine out of context and spend a week obsessing over every single syllable and then pretend to discover some hidden meaning in what i saidjust imagine for a second if the media spent this energy holding the politicians accountable who got innocent americans like kate steinle killed  she was gunned down by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five timesjust imagine if the media spent this much time investigating the poverty and joblessness in our inner citiesjust think about how much different things would be if the media in this country sent their cameras to our border or to our closing factories or to our failing schools or if the media focused on what dark secrets must be hidden in the 33000 emails hillary clinton deletedinstead every story is told from the perspective of the insiders it the narrative of the people who rigged the system never the voice of the people it been rigged againstso many people suffering in silence no cameras no coverage no outrage from a media class that seems to get outraged over just about everything elseso again it not about me it never been about me it about all the people in this country who dont have a voicei am running to be their voicei am running to be the voice for every forgotten part of this country that has been waiting and hoping for a better futurei am glad that i make the powerful a little uncomfortable now and again  including some powerful people in my own party because it means i am fighting for real changethere a reason the hedge fund managers the financial lobbyists the wall street investors are throwing their money at hillary clinton because they know she will make sure the system stays rigged in their favorit the powerful protecting the powerfulthe insiders fighting for the insidersi am fighting for youhere is the change i proposeon terrorism we are going to end the era of nationbuilding and

life those who believe in oppressing women gays hispanics africanamericans and people of different faiths are not welcome to join our countrywe will promote our america values our american way of life and our american system of government which are all the best in the worldmy opponent on the other hand wants a 550 increase in syrian refugees her plan would bring in roughly 620000 refugees from all

overseas and we are going to make it easier for young americans to get the credit they need to start a small business and pursue their dreamson education we are going to give students choice and allow charter schools to thrive we are going to end tenure policies that reward bad teachers and hurt good ones my opponent wants to deny students choice and opportunity all to get a little bit more money from the education bureaucracy she doesnt care how many young dreams are dashed in the processwe are going to work closely with africanamerican parents and students in the inner cities  and what a big difference that will make this means a lot to me and it is going to be a top priority in a trump administrationon healthcare we are going to repeal and replace obamacare countless americans have been

as americans we are going to reject the bigotry of hillary clinton which sees communities of color only as votes and not as human beings worthy of a better futureif africanamerican voters give donald trump a chance by giving me their vote the result for them will be amazing look at how badly things are going under decades of democratic leadership  look at the schools look at the 58 of young

13,it is great to be here in charlotte to discuss an issue that means so much to methat is the issue of urban renewal and the rebuilding of our inner citiestoday i want to talk about how to grow the africanamerican middle class and to provide a new deal for black america that deal is grounded in three promises safe communities great education and highpaying jobsmy vision rests on a principle that has defined this campaign america firstevery africanamerican citizen in this country is entitled to a government that puts their jobs wages and security firstim asking today for the honor of your vote and the privilege to represent you as your president here is the promise i make to you whether you vote for me or not i will be your greatest champion i have no special interest i take no orders from donors or lobbyists  i work for you and only youour campaign is about change optimism and the future i am asking people to break from the bitter failures of the past and to imagine the amazing possibilities for our futureour opponent represents the rigged system and failed thinking of yesterday her campaign offers only the depressing pessimism that says this is as good as it gets that nothing can ever really changehillary has been there for 30 years and hasnt fixed anything  she just made it worseamerican politics is caught in a time loop  we keep electing the same people who keep making the same mistakes and who keep offering the same excusesthe fact that our corrupt washington establishment has tried so hard to stop our movement is just more proof that we represent the kind of change that arrives only once in a lifetimeevery day im out on the trail proposing fresh solutions and new thinking and every day the same people getting rich off our broken system tell us that we cant change and that we cant try anything newi have a message for all the doubters in washington america future belongs to the dreamers not the cynicsand it time to extend that dream to every africanamerican citizen in this countryafricanamerican citizens have sacrificed so much for this nation they have fought and died in every war since the revolution and from the pews and the picket lines they have lifted up the conscience of our country in the long march for civil rightsyet too many africanamericans have been left behind45 of africanamerican children under the age of 6 live in poverty58 of africanamerican youth are not currently employedafricanamericans compromise roughly 13 percent of the population yet makeup 60 of murder victims under the age of 22in 2015 violent crime in charlotte increased by 18 percent  and it expected to rise 24 in 2016in the city of chicago nearly 3500 people have been shot since january of this yearthe conditions in our inner cities today are unacceptablethe democrats have run our inner cities for fifty sixty seventy years or more theyve run the school boards the city councils the mayor offices and the congressional seats their policies have failed and theyve failed miserablytheyve trapped children in failing government schools and opposed school choice at every turnthe clintons gave us nafta and china entry into the world trade organization two deals that deindustrialized america uprooted our industry and stripped bare towns like detroit and baltimore and the inner cities of north carolina this state has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since bill and hillary nafta decimating the africanamerican middle classdemocratic policies have also given rise to crippling crime and violencethen there is the issue of taxation and regulation massive taxes massive regulation of small business and radical restrictions on american energy have driven jobs and opportunities out of our inner cities hillary wants to raise taxes on successful small businesses as high as 45 percent  which will only drive more jobs out of your community and into other countriesone of the greatest betrayals has been the issue of immigration illegal immigration violates the civil rights of africanamericans no group has been more economicallyharmed by decades of illegal immigration than lowincome africanamerican workers hillary pledge to enact open borders  made in secret to a foreign bank  would destroy the africanamerican middle classat the center of my revitalization plan is the issue of trade massive chronic trade deficits have emptied out our jobs just look at what has happened to baltimore detroit pittsburgh cleveland and right here in north carolina it the greatest jobs theft in the history of the worldif im president and the executives at ford motor company announce they are moving their plants and jobs to mexico i will pick up the phone and make a simple call i will tell those executives that if they move their factories to mexico i will put a 35 tax on their product before they ship it back into the united states we wont let your jobs be stolen from you anymore when we stop the offshoring to lowwage countries we raise wages at home  meaning rent and bills become instantly more affordableat the same time my plan to lower the business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent will bring thousands of new companies onto our shores it also includes a massive middle class tax cut taxfree childcare savings accounts and childcare tax deductions and creditsi will also propose tax holidays for innercity investment and new tax incentives to get foreign companies to relocate in blighted american neighborhoods i will further empower cities and states to seek a federal disaster designation for blighted communities in order to initiate the rebuilding of vital infrastructure the demolition of abandoned properties and the increased presence of law enforcementi will also pursue financial reforms to make it easier for young africanamericans to get credit to pursue their dreams in business and create jobs in their communities doddfrank has been a disaster making it harder for small businesses to get the credit they need the policies of the clintons brought us the financial recession  through lifting glasssteagall pushing subprime lending and blocking reforms to fannie and freddie it time for a 21st century glass steagall and as part of that a priority on helping africanamerican businesses get the credit they needwe will also encourage smallbusiness creation by allowing social welfare workers to convert poverty assistance into repayable but forgiveable microloansthen there is the issue of public safety making our communities safe again will be a priority for the trump administrationi have heard and have listened to the concerns raised by africanamerican citizens about our justice system and i promise that under a trump administration the law will be applied fairly equally and without prejudice there will be only one set of rules  not a twotiered system of justice the best evidence of unequal justice is that hillary clinton could violate so many laws bleach and delete 33000 emails after a congressional subpoena lie to congress and the fbi  put our national security at grave risk  and not even face so much as a fineequal justice also means the same rules for wall street the obama administration never held wall street accountablewe will also police our streets i want every poor africanamerican child to be able to walk down the street in peace safety is a civil right the problem is not the presence of police but the absence of police i will invest in training and funding both local and federal law enforcement operations to remove the gang members drug dealers and criminal cartels from our neighborhoods the reduction of crime is not merely a goal  but a necessity we will get it done the war on police urged on by my rival is reckless and dangerous and puts africanamerican lives at risk we must work with our police not against themon immigration my policy is simple i will restore the civil rights of africanamericans hispanicamericans and all americans by ending illegal immigration i will reform visa rules to give american workers preference for jobs and i will suspend reckless refugee admissions from terrorprone regions that cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars a portion of the money saved by enforcing our laws and suspending refugees will be reinvested in our inner cities it is time to help the american citizens who have become refugees in their own countryinfrastructure will be another major goal my contract calls for 1 trillion dollars in infrastructure investment of which the inner cities will be a major beneficiaryi will also cancel all wasteful climate change spending from obamaclinton including all global warming payments to the united nations these steps will save 100 billion over 8 years and this money will be used to help rebuild the vital infrastructure including water systems in america inner citiesschool choice is at the center of my plan my proposal redirects education spending to allow every disadvantaged child in america to attend the public private charter magnet religious or home school of their choice school choice is the great civil rights issue of our time and i will be the nation biggest cheerleader for school choice in all 50 states i will also appoint a commission to investigate the school to prison pipeline and to shut it down and create a new pathway that leads from a great education to a great job my plan will also ensure funding for historical black colleges and universities more affordable 2 and 4year college and support for trade and vocational educationfinally today my agenda includes the protection of religious liberty the promotion of family and support for the africanamerican churchthis is just the beginning because i will never ever take the africanamerican community for granted it will be my mission to prove to this country that yesterday does not have to be tomorrow the cycle of poverty can be broken and great new things can happen for our peoplebut to achieve this future we must reject the failed elites in washington whove been wrong about virtually everything for decadesthe people opposing us promised that passing nafta and opening our markets to china would bring a new era of prosperity and job creation instead they brought only poverty and heartachethe people opposing us are the same people whove wasted 6 trillion on wars in the middle east that have produced only more terrorism more death and more suffering  imagine if that money had been spent at homemy opponent unleashed isis on the world she tried to build democracy in libya and failed she tried to build democracy in iraq and failed she tried regime change in egypt and failed she pressed regime change in syria and failed she tried a russian reset that failed she tried an asia pivot that failed now hillary clinton wants to confront nucleararmed russia with a shooting war in syria that could lead us into world war iiifinally our opponents passed a healthcare law embraced by hillary clinton over the furious objections of the american voter obamacare is now destroying our healthcare system  premiums are skyrocketing doubledigits and are surging by more than 100 in the great state of arizona doctors are quitting insurers are leaving and companies are fleeing every prediction they made about this law was a lie if we dont repeal and replace this disastrous law we will lose our healthcare system forevernow is the time to embrace a new directionive been very lucky and have led a great life now i want to give back to the country which has been so good to me i just left a hotel on pennsylvania avenue in washington dc delivered under budget and ahead of schedule creating thousands of jobs including construction it will be one of the finest hotels anywhere in the world and a great symbol for our country i took two hours to fly into washington to cut the ribbon with my children and then jump on the plane to be here with you i wanted to be there for my children who worked so hard on this hotel  parents must stick with encourage and support their children they did a great job on the hotel and i told them so likewise the workers did a magnificent job  without them it could never have been built so quickly and so beautifully the rebuilding we did of the old post office is the rebuilding i want to do for our countryi want to go into the inner cities the poor rural communities and the failing schools and i want to work on a national plan for revitalization im tired of the excuses from our politicians im tired of being told what cant be done im tired of people asking americans to defer their dreams to another day but really another decadeenough waiting the time is now there is nothing we cant accomplish there is no task or project too great there is no dream outside our reacheverywhere i go in this country all i see is untapped potential waiting to be set free but we will never realize that potential if we continue putting our faith in a broken political system that has let us down time and again we have to choose the more optimistic path  we have to choose to believe not in our politicians but to believe in ourselves and in our country if we do that anything is possibleim asking america to join me in dreaming big and bold things for our future let close the history books on the failures in washington and let open a new chapter of success and prosperity for everyonei am humbled beyond words to be the nominee for the party of abraham lincoln and it is my highest and greatest hope that the republican party can be the home of the africanamerican vote once againtogether we will have a government of by and for the peopleand we will make america great again for all americans

simple promise to every american safetywe are going to make america safe againthe rioting in our streets is a threat to all peaceful citizens it must be endedthe main victims of these violent demonstrations are lawabiding africanamericans who live in these communities and only want to raise their children in peacewho is looking out for themfor every one violent disruptor there are thousands of moms and dads in those same communities who just want their kids to be able to walk home safely from schoolto all our citizens in all of our inner cities and all across the country i say these words to you tonight im with you and i will fight for youthe job of a leader is to stand in someone else shoes and see things from their perspective hillary clinton calls people who dont support her deplorable and irredeemable i call anyone who doesnt support me an american citizen who is entitled to equal representation under the lawi will be a president for all americans and i will campaign for every last vote in every last communityi will extend my hand to every mayor in this country who wants to be a partner in making our cities safer for their citizensbut to do this we must work with our police  not against our policethose peddling the narrative of cops as a racist force in our society  a narrative supported with a nod by my opponent  share directly in the responsibility for the unrest that is afflicting our country and hurting those who have the very leastlowincome africanamericans in these communities are the ones suffering in terms of lost jobs lost property values and lost lives65 people have been shot in the city of chicago alone since fridaythe problem is not that there are too many police the problem is that there are not enough policepolice are entrusted with immense responsibility and we must do everything we can to ensure they are properly trained that they respect all members of the public and that any wrongdoing is always vigorously addressedbut our men and women in blue also need our support our thanks and our gratitude they are the line separating civilization from chaoshillary clinton does not have to worry about the sirens and the gunshots at night no it the poor family living in the inner city  it the mother who feels like a refugee in her own countrywho is there to represent these familieshillary clinton doesnt want to hear their voices so i will be their voice and i will be a voice for all of the forgotten americans in this country people who just want a secure community for their families good schools for the kids and a goodpaying job to support their loved oneswe will bring security to our africanamerican communities and to our latino communities we will also bring school choice and new prosperitydemocrats have run our inner cities for more than half a century it time for change  it time for a new american futuremy economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words jobs jobs jobsmy opponent likes to say that for decades she has been fighting for women that she has been fighting for children why then are 70 million american women and children living in poverty or on the brink of poverty why has she provided no relief for the millions of americans in search of affordable reliable quality childcare you know the old saying watch what i do not what i sayat the trump organization and in my campaign for president women occupy some of the highest positions i have employed thousands of women in my company women of different backgrounds women of many talentsand just last week here in pennsylvania i was joined by my daughter ivanka and i laid out my plan for childcare and eldercarewe have also talked about improving education and i will talk about it more tonight a firstclass public school education as well as options for alternatives through charter schools school choice and homeschooling is a right not a privilege the opportunity to attend a two or fouryear college or to pursue a trade or a skill set through vocational and technical education should be easier to access pay for and finish education is the bedrock of our societywomen also value security they want a commanderinchief that will defeat radical islamic terrorism and protect our borders as i campaign across this country i hear so many stories and pleas from women especially about drug addiction and opioid use they are doing their best in their communities and for their families to provide a safe and nurturing environmentbut even the bestlaid plans cannot always protect our youth and increasingly many adults from the scourge of drugs we lose thousands of our fellow americans every year to opioid use i will stop the drug inflow from our borders these drugs come over the border and make their way into our urban and rural communities and into our suburbsthis must change every change starts with a conversation together we will have this conversation and we will make this changethe changes will start immediatelyon my first day in office i am going to immediately begin lifting all regulations that are hurting our workers and our businessesthis will unleash a technology revolution america will become the best place to innovate and to invest in the future the next great american invention the next great improvement to our lives is right around the corner all we have to do is remove the red tapeour plan includes one of the biggest tax reforms in american history it going to include a 15 tax rate for all businesses small and large making our country a magnet for new jobswe are going to unleash an american energy revolution oil coal natural gas shale energy and renewables this will add at least half a million new jobs every single yearbut to be a prosperous nation we need to be a country that makes and builds things in our own countrythat is why i will direct the department of commerce to identify every single violation of our trading rules by our foreign competitors we will apply every lawful remedy to end these trade abusessteel jobs and all manufacturing jobs will be returning to pennsylvania in a very big wayyour state has lost onethird of your manufacturing jobs since nafta and onefourth of your manufacturing jobs since china joined the world trade organization these were both bill clinton deals backed by hillary clintonthe clintons robbed pennsylvania stole your jobs and shipped them to other countries  we are going to bring them backjobs will come flowing back in all over americait used to be that cars were made in flint and you couldnt drink the water in mexico today the cars are made in mexico and you cant drink the water in flintwere going to turn it all aroundthere a reason the hedge fund managers are all donating to hillary clinton campaign  and not mine everybody getting rich off the rigged system and who wants nothing to change are throwing their money at hillary clintonmy campaign is powered by my own money and by small dollar donations from everyday patriotic citizens95 of our donors are small dollar donations every dollar helps us deliver your country back to you  visit donaldjtrumpcom to find out how you can help our movementlet me tell you what else were going to doone of the biggest problems facing young people and families today is the cost of college education the cost of college has increased by over 500 since 1973but what a lot of people dont know is that universities get massive tax breaks for their massive endowments these huge multibillion dollar endowments are taxfree but too many of these universities dont use the money to help with tuition and student debtinstead these universities use the money to pay their administrators or put donors names on buildings or just store the money away in fact many universities spend more on private equity fund managers than tuition programsbut they should be using the money on the students  for tuition for student life and for student housingon top of that the federal government spends over 70 billion in higher education every year plus another 130 billion on federal loanshere again the universities dont use the money to reduce the price of college  but to increase itwe have to break this cycle im going to work with congress on reforms to make sure that if universities want access to all of these special federal tax breaks and tax dollars  paid for by you  that they are making a good faith effort to reduce the cost of college and student debt and to spend their endowments on their own studentsanother major issue for all american families is healthcare president obama promised obamacare would reduce the cost of healthcare by 2500 dollars instead the opposite happened  the cost of healthcare has increased nearly 5000 dollars during that timejust one more washington lie  like the lie that if you like your doctor you can keep your doctorit a disasterthat is why on my first day i am going to ask congress to immediately send me a bill to repeal and replace disastrous obamacarewe are going to replace governmentrun obamacare with reforms that put patients first these reforms include expanding access to popular healthcare savings accounts empowering americans to shop for the insurance of their choice across state lines and block granting medicaid to the states so they can design innovative solutions to best serve our most vulnerable citizenshillary clinton on the other hand wants to give obamacare to illegal immigrants and wants a total government takeover of healthcareher plan also gives social security and medicare to illegal immigrants by making them citizens  bankrupting these programs for americansshe doesnt understand how democracy works public servants are just that  theyre there to serve you but the only people hillary clinton has ever served are the special interestsour campaign is about breakingup the special interest monopoly in washington dc were trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors the large corporations and the media executivestheyre all part of the same political establishment they go to the same restaurants they attend the same conferences they have the same friends and connections they all support the same ideology of globalism that makes them rich while shipping your jobs your factories and your wealth to other countriesi am not running to be president of the world i am running to be president of the united states i am for america  and america firsttogether we will rebuild this country beyond our greatest dreamsgovernment

neighborhoods the failing schools the forgotten stretches of this nation and unlock their potential for all of our peopleive made a living for years looking at unused spaces and imagining what they could be politicians look at blighted neighborhoods and offer only excuses  i look at those same neighborhoods and offer solutionswe spend so much time thinking about how things used to be weve

16,thank you it great to be here todayin particular i want to thank mr ron packard and ms deborah mays for hosting me at their schooltoday we are going to discuss one of the most important issues in this campaign school choicebut before we do i want to briefly discuss new revelations about hillary clinton emails according to the fbi report the fbi did find that hostile foreign actors gained access to the personal email accounts of individuals with whom clinton was in regular contact and in doing so obtained emails sent to or received by clinton on her personal accountremember hillary clinton was emailing about the drone program  among many other extremely sensitive mattersthis is yet more evidence that hillary clinton is unfit to be commanderinchief by the way the whole country saw how unfit she was at the townhall last night where she refused to take accountability for her failed policies in the middle east that have produced millions of refugees unleashed the horror of radical islamic terrorism and made us less safe than ever beforethroughout it all she put the entire country at risk in order to coverup her payforplay scandals as secretary of state these include scandals like giving up our uranium to russia doing favors for ubs bank and selling contracts to friends and family in haitiit all about hiding her criminal enterprise at the clinton foundationas part of her criminal coverup hillary clinton staff digitally bleached her emails after receiving a congressional subpoena her staff also destroyed some of her 13 different phones with a hammerthen when she was interviewed by the fbi she claimed she couldnt remember important events 39 times she couldnt even remember whether she was trained on handling classified information she even said she didnt know that the letter c stood for confidential classified informationall the while as hillary and bill raked in millions of dollars from special interests the world fell apart hillary clintons policies produced ruin in libya iraq and syria she failed in russia in china in north koreaher policies unleashed isis spread terrorism and put iran on the path to nuclear weapons  not to mention the ransom paymentson top of it all hillary clinton is triggerhappy she raced to invade intervene and topple regimes she believes in globalism not americanismlast night she even falsely said no american died in libya then she also falsely said there no ground troops in iraq even though we have 5000 military personnel there right nowiraq is one of the biggest differences in this race i opposed going in and i opposed the reckless way hillary clinton took us out  letting isis fill the voidbut i was opposed to the war from the beginninglong after howard stern but three months before the iraq war started i said in an interview with neil cavuto that perhaps  shouldnt be doing it yet and that the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the president is concernedthen on march 25th of 2003 just days after the war started i was quoted as saying the war is a mess yet more clear evidence that i had opposed the war from the startin july of 2003 i said that i would love to see new york city and some of the cities and some of the states get some of the money that`s going toward iraq and other places because you know they really need and it they need it badly i had a number of quotes to this effectthen in august of 2004 very early in the conflict i made a detailed statement to esquire magazinelook at the war in iraq and the mess that were in i would never have handled it that way does anybody really believe that iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to step up to lead the country cmon two minutes after we leave there going to be a revolution and the meanest toughest smartest most vicious guy will take overwhat was the purpose of the whole thing hundreds and hundreds of young people killed and what about the people coming back with no arms and no legs not to mention the other side all those iraqi kids whove been blown to pieces and it turns out that all of the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong all this for nothing!i would have been tougher on terrorism bin laden would have been caught long agohad i been in congress at the time of the invasion i would have cast a vote in opposition for years i have been a critic of the kind of reckless foreign invasions and interventions that have been the hallmark of hillary clinton failed careerhere is the bottom line i was a private citizen i had no access to the briefings that hillary clinton had but in iraq my judgement was right and hers was wronghillary clinton is always complaining about what wrong but she been there for more than 30 years and has never done anything about it  all you have to do is look at new york state when she was a senator all talk but nothing happenedwere on track to spend 6 trillion altogether on the wars in iraq and afghanistanmeanwhile massive portions of our country are in a state of disrepairit time to rebuild americatoo many americans living in our inner cities have not been included in the american dreamwe are one nation and when any part of our country hurts  our whole country hurtsmy goal as president will be to ensure that every child in this nation  africanamerican hispanicamerican all americans  will be placed on the ladder of success a great education and a great jobthat ladder rests on a fundamental foundation safetyin order to help our children succeed our first duty is to ensure that every kid in america can grow up in a safe communityyou cant have prosperity without securitythis is the new civil rights agenda of our time the right to a safe community a quality education and a secure jobour campaign represents the longawaited chance to break with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a new american futurethere is no failed policy more in need of urgent change than our governmentrun education monopolythe democratic party has trapped millions of africanamerican and hispanic youth in failing government schools that deny them the opportunity to join the ladder of american successit is time to breakup that monopolyi want every single inner city child in america who is today trapped in a failing school to have the freedom  the civil right  to attend the school of their choice this includes private schools traditional public schools magnet schools and charter schools which must be included in any definition of school choiceour government spends more than enough money to easily pay for this initiative  with billions left over it simply a matter of putting students first not the education bureaucracylet run through the numbersat the state and federal level the united states spends more than 620 billion on k12 education each year that an average of about 12296 for every student enrolled in our elementary and secondary public schoolsthe federal government pays for about 10 percent64 billion to be preciseof the k12 costs that 64 billion makes up about half of the total spending of the us department of educationthe other roughly 570 billion spent on k12 education comes from the stateswe spend more per student than almost any other major country in the world yet our students perform near the bottom of the pack for major large advanced countriesour largest cities spend some of the largest amounts of money on public schoolsnew york city spends 20226 dollars per pupilbaltimore spends 15287 dollars per studentchicago spends 11976 dollars per student and in los angeles it is 10602just imagine if each student in these school systems was given a scholarship for this amount of money  allowing them and their family to choose the public or private school of their choicenot only would this empower families but it would create a massive education market that is competitive and produces better outcomesthese schools would then cater to the needs of the individual student and family  not the needs of the teachers union there is no more important job than a teacher and teachers will benefit greatly from these reformsthe current government monopoly while great for the bureaucrats has utterly failed too many studentsaccording to the national assessment of education progress only 1 in 6 africanamerican students in the eighth grade are considered proficient in math and readingfailing schools then contribute to failing economiesin los angeles the official unemployment rate for africanamerican men is almost 207 percent in baltimore it is 162 percent 147 percent in chicago and 109 percent in new york cityin los angeles 26 percent of african american women live in poverty in baltimore the poverty rate for african americans is 27 percent in new york over 31 percent of african americans live in povertynationwide nearly 40 of africanamerican children live in poverty  including 45 of children under the age of sixour public schools are failing to put young americans on a path to successmeanwhile we have all seen the tragic rise in crime in these communities  which remains one of the greatest barriers to fostering opportunity and success for america childrenviolent crime rose more than 20 in los angeles in 2015 homicides in baltimore increased by 63 there have been nearly 3000 victims of shootings in chicago so far this yeargovernment is failing our citizens at every levelthat is why i am proposing a plan to provide school choice to every disadvantaged student in americathat means parents will be able to send their kids to the desired public private or religious school of their choicehere is how it will workright now about 19 billion is spent on fifty private school choice programs nationwide these are opportunity scholarships tax credits and education savings accounts this covers about 400000 students in our countryaltogether school choice is serving more than 34 million students nationwidecharter schools in particular have demonstrated amazing gains and results in providing education to disadvantaged children and the success of these schools will be a top priority for my administrationthey also produce competition that causes better outcomes for everyonemy first budget will immediately add an additional federal investment of 20 billion towards school choice this will be done by reprioritizing existing federal dollarsspecifically my plan will use 20 billion of existing federal dollars to establish a block grant for the 11 million school age kids living in povertywe will give states the option to allow these funds to follow the student to the public or private school they attend distribution of this grant will favor states that have private school choice and charter laws encouraging them to participatethis 20 billion will instantly extend choice to millions more studentsa state like ohio will benefit greatly from these new funds ohio is a leader in school choice ohio has 5 private school choice programs that serve over 30000 students and 384 charter schools serving 123844 studentsbut the 20 billion is only the beginning as president i will establish the national goal of providing school choice to every american child living in povertythat means that we want every disadvantaged child to be able to choose the local public private charter or magnet school that is best for them and their familyeach state will develop its own formula but we want the dollars to follow the student9 in 10 dollars spent on k12 education is spent at the state and local level to achieve this longterm goal we will have to make this a shared national mission  to bring hope to every child in every city in this landi will use the pulpit of the presidency to campaign for this in all 50 states and i will call upon the american people to elect officials at the city state and federal level who support school choicemy administration will partner with the leadership of any inner city in america  chicago baltimore detroit  that is willing to run a pilot program to provide school choice to every child in that community in baltimore for instance that would mean more than 15000 funds available per studenti am confident that the politicians will not be able to suppress the will of the people anymoreif we can put a man on the moon dig out the panama canal and win two world wars then i have no doubt that we as a nation can provide school choice to every disadvantaged child in americaif the states collectively contribute another 110 billion of their own education budgets toward school choice on top of the 20 billion in federal dollars that could provide 12000 in school choice funds to every k12 student who today lives in povertythe money will follow the student that means the student will be able to attend the public private charter or magnet school of their choice  and each state will develop its own system that works best for themas your president i will be the nation biggest cheerleader for school choice i understand many stale old politicians will resist but it time for our country to start thinking big once again we spend too much time quibbling over the smallest words when we should spend our time dreaming about the great adventures that lie aheadi will also support meritpay for teachers so that we reward great teachers  instead of the failed tenure system that rewards bad teachers and punishes good onesat the same time we have to ensure that jobs are waiting for our young kids when they graduate high school and collegemy policies will add millions of new jobs to our country especially for our africanamerican and hispanic communitiesmy plan to lift restrictions on the production of american energy will not only make home energy bills cheaper but it will add an estimated half a million jobs per yearby reducing radical regulation and overtaxation we can bring thousands of new companies into our poorest communitiescrucially my trade reforms will create a manufacturing revival in america we have a nearly 800 billion dollar annual trade deficit with the world  that money coming straight out of states like ohio pennsylvania michigan maine and so many others by ending foreign currency manipulation product dumping and other predatory trading practices we will be able to open thousands of new plants and factories across americathe future is filled with limitless possibilities for our nation and exciting opportunities for our childrenall we have to do is cut our ties with the failed politics of the past weve had a failed foreign policy a failed education policy a failed economic policy and underneath it all a failed political system that rewards politicians for how many donors they have  or how many journalists they know  not how many americans they help to live better livesbut the failures of the past are about to endthose failures end beginning on november 8thwe will have one american nationwe will be one american peoplewe are fighting to give every child in every forgotten stretch of this country the chance to live out their dreams in safety and peacethat means a safe neighborhood a quality education and a secure highpaying jobthis is how we will rebuild our futurethis is how we will make america great again  for everyonethank you

base and the united states air force academy good place ive got many friends that went to the air force academy all very smart they love their airplanes that i can tell you the courage and selflessness of our service members and their devotion to each other and to their country are the traits that we need to make america great again great people together were going to deliver real change that puts america first you dont hear that term very much we dont hear that term very much anymore do we america first right if i win it going to be america first every single time that i can tell you believe me were going to end the government corruption and were going to drain the swamp in washington dc we are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals end illegal immigration stop the massive inflow of refugees from other countries reduce surging crime cut taxes big league and end regulations unleash jobproducing american energy rebuild our great military which sadly has become very depleted but the greatest people on earth were going to take care of our veterans like they have never been taken care of before and repeal and replace the disaster known as obamacare your jobs will come back under a trump administration your incomes will go up under a trump administration your taxes will go down under a trump administration your country and i tell you your country is so proud of you but right now we have to help our country we have to help our country it is under siege in so many ways by the way you could almost stay especially from the dishonest media that for sure very dishonest your companies wont be leaving colorado under a trump administration theyll be expanding and there will be new companies coming in right now were not growing at all as a nation you look at our jobs report a disaster last week a jobs report total disaster look at our gnp total disasterunder my plan were going to grow at 4 percent right now were at about 1 percent china at 7 percent india at 8 percent were at 1 percent and it going to be going down if we keep if hillary clinton gets in you will set record lows believe me that i can tell you were going to create at least 25 million new jobs in 10 years and by the way did you see the protesters yesterday where they call them the protesters are paid a lot of money by the dnc and i kept saying i wonder why those people are here because they never seem to have much on their mind other than stand up and protestand yesterday it came out but it was barely covered by the media but it all over the media they were busted they were paid 1500 each and were given cell phones go up and disturb trump rallies and i sort of always knew it in chicago even last night we had people stand up for no reason it like what are they doing here and can you imagine that a big story hardly covered by the media so bad were also going to create a new government that answers to the people hillary clintonhillary clinton is the most corrupt person ever to run for the presidency she shouldnt be allowed to run for the presidency after what she done ill tell you it true newly released two days ago fbi documents reveal just how deep the corruption goes the undersecretary of state patrick kennedy illegally pressured the fbi to unclassify emails from hillary clinton illegal server it hard to believe and nothing happens to her folks and nothing ever happens in other words the state department was trying to cover up hillary crime of sending classified information on a server our enemies could easily access the fbi document show that patrick kennedy made the request for altering classification as part of a very very serious quid pro quo not allowed to do it this is a felony corruption yesterday i said undersecretary kennedy must immediately resign the media barely covers this event by the way this is a bigger event than watergate and they practically refuse to cover it today im calling for him to be fired clinton and her cronies have sacrificed your security your family safety and your country safety as though it meant nothing at all to her remember also that hillary lied under oath to congress saying that she never sent or received classified information on her secret server right she never received it on that insecure server that she should have never been allowed to have that youre not allowed to have and pretended not to know remember this one that the letter c meant confidential information was classified she thought it was the lettering of a paragraph there never been a time in our country history where anything like this has gone on and the fbi there must be people in there based on what you read that are ashamed of what happened and the department of justice there must be people in there that are ashamed absolutely ashamed of what been going onhillary then told the fbi she couldnt remember 39 times and then in written testimony last week under oath she said that she couldnt remember another 21 times bad memory she got a terrible memory this elaborate criminal cover up included hillary deleting and bleaching of 33000 emails the disappearance of 13 iphones some by hammers two boxes of email evidence gone missing that was as of last week can you imagine theyre now missing on top of everything else two boxes of emails and the destruction of laptops in a secret deal with the fbi this truly is and i said it this truly is many times worse than watergate and were going to put an end to it on november 8th going to do it another series of leaked emails show top officials in the clinton campaign scheming to take massive sums of money from registered foreign lobbyists and then you wonder why we do so badly but you dont hear the media talking about that at all do you you dont see it at all as wikileaks proved the media is merely and it truly is it just an extension of the clinton campaign the press has created a rigged system and poisoned the mind of so many of our voters they have rigged it from the beginning by telling totally false stories most recently about phony allegations where i have been under constant attack they attack my business i built a great business but although most people do admit that they attacked my wonderful family they attacked my temperamentbut i built an incredible company those papers are filed and im fortunate to have a beautiful and loving family you all saw melania last night on television did a great job that she even has to do that is a shame and my temperament has always been just about my greatest strength we have a winning temperament our country doesnt win anymore we dont win anymore this is an election about truth and youre not going to get it from the dishonest mediasome people cant handle the truth no matter what people may think of me the one thing they know is that were going to tell the american people where we stand where we are were going to tell them the truth now even though were doing pretty good in the polls i dont believe the polls anymore i dont believe them i dont believe them and if there 10 and if there one or two bad ones that the only one they showbelieve me folks were doing great if we keep our spirit and if we go out and win this is another brexit believe me they are so worried that why theyve become vicious and hostile and dirty because they see what going on this rally set up just a short while ago look at the number of people packed but every rally is the same way at her rallies very few people show up when she has the energy to go to the event which isnt often she doing debate prep she did so much debate prep did we beat her badly in that second debate sort of funny she been doing this for 30 years now she has to do debate prep for five days you know what the debate prep is it resting it lying down going to sleep i think the media trying to discourage our people from going out to vote and it was just brought up to me by a reporter in the backthey said you know it very interesting when you were fighting 17 people the media was nasty but they really got nasty when we started to take the lead in the polls they said wait a minute this thing going to happen it going to happenchange stop our jobs from leaving our companies from leaving strengthen our military preserve our second amendment theyre saying this is going to happen and it is true made up stories theyre liars and made up storieswithout the media and all of the other corrupt entities that have helped her along the way she would be nothing she would be nothing she reallyshe would be doing so badly even my worst critics agree that the media has come after us like they have never come after anyone before it my badge of honori mean you know what am i going to do even the new york times which is totally dishonest by the wayhere the good news about the new york times they wont be in business much longer do you see what theyre losing they are dying they are dying and theyre dying also because theyre very dishonest but one of their biggest columnistreporters wrote a story about how bad it is he said let face itthis is in the new york times balance has been on vacation since mr trump stepped onto this golden trump tower escalator to announce his candidacycan you believe that theyre admitting it they dont even care it actually said that we dont care they will do anything to stop what were doing not me it what were doing it an agenda it going to agenda of change but we wont let them stop maybe the greatest movement in the history of our countryhistory is watching us now waiting to see if we will rise to the moment we have to rise we have to do it were under tremendous opposition we have the greatest people in the world that what ive learned somebody said what the most important thing you learned how great the american people are ive gone all over the countryi have two things ive learned that and ive learned how totally dishonest the media is it so dishonest ive learned that too they are the most dishonest people ive ever dealt with not all of them but honestly like 75 percent some are very good but for the most part yeswe have stories that we think are going to unbelievable stories they turn outthey make them as bad as possible we have stories on the other side that would normally dismantle a campaign and they dont even report them it a disgrace what going on is a disgracebut weve only just begun to fight believe me we have three weeks you know what we have three weeks and i hear were going great in colorado my people in back said youre going to win colorado doesnt matter what they say get out and vote but they even want to try and rig the election at the polling booths where so many cities are corrupt and you see that and voter fraud is all too common and then they criticize us for saying that and we have even republicans oh that such a terrible thing to saywell take a look at philadelphia what been going on take a look at chicago take a look at st louis take a look at some of these cities where you see things happening that are horrendous and if you talk about them they say bad things about you they call you a racist they call you alland by the way speaking of that nobody will do more for the africanamerican citizens of this country than donald trump nobody nobody nobody will do more for the latino community than donald trump i can tell youin 2014 the washington post another beauty published an article entitled could noncitizens decide the november election the article found that 14 percent of noncitizens were registered to vote 14 percent were registered to vote and were not supposed to talk about it and your republican leaders said oh thiseverything is peachydory right and it also found noncitizen voting may have given democrats the pivotal sixtieth vote needed to pass obamacare it a washington policy not methe system is also rigged by the donors giving hundreds of millions of dollars to crooked hillary campaign it rigged it a bad system the reason hillary clinton pushes for naftaor the transpacific partnership which will also be a disasternafta the worst trade deal ever signed ever made by anybody in the worldwere a oneway highway out we get the drugs right we get the drugs we get the unemployment we get the empty factories mexico and other countries get the cash they get the employment they get the plantsand for completely open bordersshe wants completely open borders is because her international donors control her every move if we let crooked hillary cartel andand just remember thisrun this government history will record that 2017 was the year that america lost truly lost its independence truly lost its independenceand by the way this is our final shot folks in four years it over youre never going to be able to win youre never going to be able to win it tilting it going to be a oneparty system this is your final shot for the supreme court for your second amendment i mean this is your final shot november 8thso hopefully youll do what you know you have to do get out of bed and vote no matter how youre feeling no matter how youre feelingit is indeed time to drain the swamp in washington dc this is why im proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again first im going to institute a fiveyear ban on all executive branch officials lobbying the government after they leave government service rightsecond im going to ask congress to institute its own fiveyear ban on lobbying by former members of congress and their staffs that a simple one and they know this should be done but theyre not going to do it but theyll do it if i get inim going to number three expand the definition of lobbyists so that we close all the loopholes that former government officials use by labeling themselves right ive been talking about that for years decades of failure in washington and decades of special interest dealing must and will come to an end and remember by the time this ends i will have spent over 100 million on my campaign hillary spent nothing she gets all her money from the special interest donors and my interest is you my interest is you we have to break the cycle of corruption and we have to give new voices to change and we have towe have nodo we have a choice so that we can have a government that works again and can function properly which our government doesnt right now including giving iran 17 billion in cash and remember the deportation of 800 people turned out to be 800 people then went to 1800 peopleand they were going to be deported for good reason you know if our country deports somebody theyve got to be pretty pretty out there well they pressed the wrong button and congratulations we have 1800 new citizens of the united statesand when i said undo it they said that wouldnt be constitutional hey folks how stupid are we being led the time for congressional term limits has finally arrived not only will it end our government corruption but we will end the economic stagnation that were in right now no growthmy plan for the economy can be summed up in three very beautiful words jobs jobs jobs it will happen at the center of our historic jobs plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals which ive wanted to do from the beginning 47 million americans are in poverty and 45 million americans are living right now on food stamps it hard to believe this is our countrywe have nearly an 800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world and the worst socalled recovery since the great depression do you know that the worst since the great depression colorado has lost one in seven manufacturing jobs since bill clinton signed nafta and a deal supported by hillary clinton very stronglyand this i thought was a typographical error because i figured they meant 700 or 7000 but it wasnt weve lost 70000 factories since china entry into the world trade organization another bill and hillary backed disasterwe are living through the greatest job theft in the history of the world more jobs have been stolen from our country so stupidly we let them go we let our companies go so foolishly we dont know what were doing a trump administration is going to renegotiate nafta stand up to the foreign cheating and stop the jobs from leaving our country and have jobs come back in the other direction as part of our plan to bring back our jobs were going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent we are right now the highesttaxed nation in the world that one of the reasons our companies are leaving were also going to fix our inner cities45 percent of africanamerican children under the age of six are living in poverty 58 percent of africanamerican youth are not working almost 3500 people have been shot in the city of chicagocan you believe this since january 1st the national murder rate has experienced the largest single year increase in more than 45 years can you believe that murder highest rate in 45 yearsso you dontthey dont seem to she said nobody cares and youre right they dont seem too so to those africanamericans suffering to those latinos suffering i say what do you have to lose elect donald trump i will fix it we will fix it we will fix it were going to get a very big africanamerican vote were going to get a very big latino vote because the democrats come in they want your vote and as soon as you give them the vote they say see you in four years they dont do anything it gotten worse and worse for both the africanamericans the latinohispanics it gotten worse and it will only get worsethey want your vote hillary clinton said she was going to fix up the state of new york when she ran for the senate it is a total disaster we will be a rich nation once again but to be a rich country we must also be a safe country our national security begins at the border speaking in secret to a foreign bank i promise we will build the wall hillary clinton said her dream is for total open trade there go your jobs and open bordersthere goes your country simple as thatthere are already a record 65 million people in the united states who speak a language other than english it in their interest and everyone interest to control immigration so past arrivals can integrate into society and really join the middle class and the upper classbut in a secret speech to goldman sachs she said citizens who want to control immigration are unamerican in other words if you want to have a border you want to have a wall which creates a country even if you want people to come in but come in through a legal process she considers that unamerican so hillary thinks most of the country is either deplorable irredeemable unamerican racist or basement dwellers in the case of the bernie sanders people she said they were basement dwellers hillary plan includes an open border with the middle east meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shoreswe will be the great trojan horse folks as sure as youre standing there just today an iraqi refugee approved for entry by hillary clinton state department pled guilty to joining isis he entered as a refugee in november of 2009 and then we approved for a green card in 2011 it one of hundreds of examples of the united states voluntarily admitting people from the world most dangerous places who turn out to be terroristsso let me state this as clearly as i can if im elected president of the united states i am going to keep radical islamic terrorist the hell out of our country we have enough problems we have enough problems weve got big problems 20 trillion in debt we have problems like you wouldnt believe well also stop the crisis of illegal immigration a trump administration will secure and defend our borders and we will build that wall and mexico will pay for that wall we just got the firstever endorsement from our ice and border patrol office first time theyve ever done it ice was just last week as secretary of state hillary clinton allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released because their home countries would not take them back they were too evil they were too evil drug lords heads of gangs i mean these people were evil they wouldnt take them backso we come over we bring they wont take them back oh take them back drop them on the streets and then you wonder why the murder rate is the highest in 45 years and other thingsthe ice officer described hillary proposal as quote the most radical

affordable childcare and healthcare and a government that is honest and decent and fairwe are the campaign of changewe will deliver jobs opportunity and justice for future generationsive wanted this race to be about the issues but the clinton campaign has refused to discuss the issues they only place they want to go is the gutterso they have slandered and libeled me with false accusations  but we will not let these lies distract us from our campaignin an earlier speech today i addressed the fact that i was falsely accused it is disgraceful that you can have front page articles in the new york times inventing false claims without any evidence any witnesses anything at alli want to talk about the policies affecting our lives and your futureright now our government has been taken hostage by global special interests that will stop at nothing to drain every last ounce of wealth from this country for their personal benefitthe greatest weapon wielded by the clinton machine is the media the wikileaks emails show that the clinton machine and the corporate media are one in the same  they collaborate and conspire togetherthis washington establishment will stop at nothing to stop all of usthese are the people who have given us decades of endless wars producing only death and bloodshed but no victorythese are the same people who have flung our doors open to radical islam putting us on the same path to france of multigenerational struggles with violence and extremism embedded in our communitiesthese are the people whove allowed violent international cartels to invade our country and prey on our most vulnerable citizens victims like marilyn pharis raped by an illegal immigrant with a lengthy criminal record and beaten to death with a hammerthese are the people whove let drugs pour into our country and poising our childrenthese are the people who emptied the jobs out of ohio pennsylvania michigan and north carolina and shipped them to other countriesthe political powers trying to stop us are the people whove stripped the jobs form our inner cities trapped millions of africanamericans and hispanicamericans in impoverished crimebesieged neighborhoods and left 70 million american women and child in poverty or near the brink of povertyat the center of this assault on american prosperity is the clinton machine they dont work for you they dont work for america the work only for themselves and their donors  including foreign government and foreign actorshillary clinton is a criminal who destroyed 33000 emails after a congressional subpoenashe ignored hundreds of requests for security in benghazi causing the deaths of four brave americans  and then she lied to the faces of the grieving parents about the reason for the attackshe defended a man who violently and viciously raped a 12 yearold girl by horribly smearing and blaming the victim  and the she laughed about getting the rapist off the hookspeaking in secret to a foreign bank hillary pledged her support for open borders that means tens of millions of new foreign workers to compete against you for your jobs your wages your futures  she selling out the future of young american of all backgrounds to enrich her donorswe wont let it happenhillary and her special interest allies want to keep children in our inner cities trapped in failing schoolsunder a trump administration disadvantaged children will be able to attend the public private charter or magnet school of their choiceunder president obama and hillary clinton the national debt has almost doubled20 trilliondollar national debt is a weight around the future of every young person in this country it would require 120000 from every millennial in the country to pay offthe new debt added under obama and clinton would have been enough to pay off all the outstanding student loans in the united states 6 times overyet not one penny of that new debt has gone to lowering your tuitionthe share of 16to28yearolds not in the labor force has increased to 45 percent during the obama administrationin a trump administration we will work every day to make america great again for millennialsfirst we will lower the cost of college and solve the student loan crisistuition at public fouryear institutions was 40 higher in the last school year than it was ten years agoin all americans owe 13 trillion on their student loansmore than auto loans credit card debt or home equity loans nationwidestudents should not be asked to pay more on their loans than they can afford and the debt should not be an albatross around their necks for the rest of their livesthat is why under my student loan program we would cap repayment to an affordable portion of a borrower income125 and if borrowers work hard and make their full payments for 15 years we will let them get on with their livesthat the nature of the deal we give many public employees todayevery american deserves the same deal so we will equalize treatment so everyone can start saving for their families and retirement by the time they are 15 years out of collegein addition i will take steps to push colleges to cut the skyrocketing cost of tuition if the federal government is going to subsidize student loans it has a right to expect that colleges work hard to control costs and invest their resources in their studentsif colleges refuse to take this responsibility seriously they will be held accountableincluding by reconsidering whether those with huge endowments deserve to keep those endowments taxexemptsome schools are paying more to hedge funds and private equity managers than they are spending on tuition assistancewhile taxpayers are guaranteeing hundreds of billions of dollars of student loans to pay for rising tuitionwe want universities to spend their endowments on their students not themselves they need to use that money to cut the college debt and college tuitionmuch of the skyrocketing cost of college education is due to the tremendous bloat in college administrators and bureaucrats according to the department of education the number of college administrators is up more than 60 percent since 1993ten times the increase in tenured faculty positionsfederal regulations are responsible for much of this administrative bloat vanderbilt university estimated that it spends 150 million per year11 percent of the university budgetto comply with government regulationsas president i will immediately take steps to drive down college costs by reducing the unnecessary costs of compliance with federal regulations so that colleges can pass on the savings to students in the form of lower tuitioni will also make it a priority to protect students rights to free speech on campus in the past few decades political correctness has transformed our institutions of higher education from ones that fostered spirited debate to a place of extreme censorship where students are silencedwe will end the political correctness and foster free and respectful dialoguewe also have to recognize that traditional fouryear degree programs are not the only path to a good job and a good career we should support schools that allow people to learn skills and practice a trade so young people can have access to the education that right for them and we must hold all schools equally accountable for their performancei will make sure that students have the information they need about all of their options before starting school and for repaying their student loans upon leaving schoolthere is a lot of room for improvement in this regard currently students navigate 16 complex repayment plans 8 forgiveness programs and 32 deferment and forbearance optionseach of these programs has their own nuances and qualifications i will simplify this confusing maze into a single incomebased repayment program similar to those that have proved so popular in recent yearswe also have to make sure that those who have graduated college and those who are soon to graduate can find a good job to start a good career when they domany mothers across this country are worried their kids wont find jobs and they are right to be worried one of the biggest threats is outsourcing  jobs for collegeeducated kids are being sent to other countries at the same time companies are importing lowwage workers on h1b visas to take jobs from young collegetrained americanswe will protect these jobs for americansmy economic plan  including tax trade regulatory and energy reforms  will create 25 million new jobs and allow the private sector to grow at 4 percent per yearthis includes reforms to protect and expand the sharing economystartups like uberthat have managed to provide great services to consumers and create lots of jobs in the processfinally and most importantly the foundation for a new prosperity will be a rededication to the constitutional rule of lawa vote for me is a vote for change and a vote for me is really a vote for youtogether we are going to make america great again

20,thank you thank you very much oh jon jon is such a great actor and such a great person he is such a great person and he really been with me a long time in a lot of different ways he been incredible so i just want to thank jon and i hope he makes another movie very quickly because i love his movies in particular i wanted to thank our host tony perkins for his years of leadership  and we know all about that and we all express our support for tony as he deals with the aftermath of the terrible floods in louisiana where two weeks ago i spent some time and i saw some incredible incredible peoplethank you  amazing amazing groupone of the greatest privileges of my journey has been the time ive spent with the evangelical community and the support they gave me in those primaries was absolutely incredible i have to tell you  all across the nation a lot of people said i wonder if donald will get the evangelicals i got the evangelicals  im going to make it up to you too you watch there are no more decent devoted or selfless people than our christians brothers and sisters here in the united states true so true ive witnessed that incredible generosity all across this land gotten to know so many people i saw it during my trip to louisiana where christian volunteers raced to help their fellow citizens in need franklin graham is an example he brought the most incredible people and equipment to louisiana  and he didnt want anything for it he a great man it that spirit of giving that we will need to rebuild louisiana and to rebuild this country which is in serious serious trouble yet our media culture often mocks and demeans people of faith and you understand that all the time i hear from concerned parents how much harder it is for a christian family to raise their children in today media environmentit is right isnt it  yeah it is right  not even close your values of love charity and faith built this nation  so how can it be that our media treats people of faith so poorly one of the reasons is that our politicians have really abandoned you to a large extent and hillary clinton you can forget about her so let me say this right up front a trump administration our christian heritage will be cherished protected defended like youve never seen before  believe me i believe it and you believe it and you know it you know it and that includes religious liberty  remember remember  i recently had a chance to visit a church in detroit great faith ministries international stand up if youre member that good that was a great  that was an amazing experience  and the bishop what a great guyin my remarks i spoke about how african american church  and this is all across the country  for centuries have been the conscience of our nation their unbreakable faith and sprit overcame some of the most difficult periods in our history leading us all to a better future very true amazing this was such an amazing experience  this is the power of faith it the power to heal it the power to unite it the power to make all of us live better lives  all of us our nation today is divided nobody likes to say it but were living in a very very divided nation it will be our faith in god and his teachings in each other that will lead us back to unity each of us here today has a role to play in bringing our country together united in common purpose and in common values so let talk today about some of the things  and these are great things  that we can do together to create the american future for everybody not just a certain group of people but for everybodythe first thing we have to do is give our churches their voice back it been taken away  the johnson amendment has blocked our pastors and ministers and others from speaking their minds from their own pulpits if they want to talk about christianity if they want to preach if they want to talk about politics theyre unable to do so if they want to do it they take a tremendous risk that they lose their taxexempt statusall religious leaders should be able to freely express their thoughts and feelings    on religious matters and i will repeal the johnson amendment    if i am elected your president i promise  so importantthank you that so importantand i must tell you from the heart this started a building of mine in manhattan i had 50 pastors in a big conference room and we actually had 50 pastors two rabbis a couple of priests we were all talking and we were there for two hours and at the end it was a lovefest we all agreed it was like a lovefestand i said to them  we were high up in a building on 5th avenue  and i said to them id love your support and i know when i can get support im quite sophisticated  and i know they wanted to give me their total support 100 percent just like i had in the primaries and i said i really would like your support and they didnt really know what i was talking about and i said what going on here they said well sir we cant do that because we would be violating the laws and i said what the punishment well we could lose our taxexempt status which of course is a you know massive penaltyi said tell me about this and we sat down they talked about it when did it happen 1954 or so lyndon johnson was having problems  powerful guy i actually as just own way  you have to gain respect for what he was able to do can you imagine that this man singlehandedly  he was having problems with churches and there was a church in houston that was giving him a hard time maybe for very good reason and he put in an amendment that basically stopped our great pastors and ministers and others from talking under the penalty of losing their taxexempt statusso we were looking down onto the sidewalk and there were people walking on the sidewalk and i said so folks what youre telling me is those people walking way way down there on the sidewalk have really more power than you do because theyre allowed to express their feelings and thoughts openly and without penalty and one of the pastors who i knew very well  and these are powerful people these are strong people with magnificent voices and just  and magnificent hearts much more importantly  they looked at me and they said that actually right they have more power than we do were not allowed to expressand that what i said we have to start thinking about this and i thought about it and then we had a large group of pastors again i said i have thought about it if i become president we are going to knock out the johnson amendment we are going to do that and it not going to be hard it not going to be hard when you  when you think from the standpoint of political you have more than men  let say men are 50 percent women are 50 percent youre much more than 50 percent added together and i actually believe that one of the reasons why you havent seen christianity and other religions within the united states going like a rocket ship  like our polls have been going in the last four weeks a rocket ship right  i really believe that because youre great people the people that you rely on on sunday and all during the week theyve been stopped from talking and speaking by a law and were going to get rid of that law and it going to get rid of  were going to get rid of it so fastand im so proud to say  honestly i dont want to take credit but you had 50 people in that first meeting and many more in the second i am so proud  i was just telling this to tony  to say that was my idea i figure it the only way im getting to heaven so this is going to be very    the only way  so were going to get rid of it and were going to let your great people speak and youre going to see something happen that going to be very very good ok so importanti hope which means you have to get out and vote on november 8th you cannot  you didnt vote four years ago you didnt voteyou did well you did a few of you did  believe me i know i look at the stats you didnt vote but this time you really have  and this is your last chance this is it i mean well never have this opportunity again so i hope you can get every one of your friends and just get up  your family and your friends and get out and vote ok november 8th  thank you  and if you do were going to win by a lot that not going to even be a close election and if you dont could be a very unhappy november 8thwere also going to repeal and replace disastrous obamacare    which gives the government control over the lives of everyday citizens and the numbers are horrendous your premiums are going up by 50 60 70 percent the deductible is so high you never get to use it unless you are going to lead a very long and very complex bad period  very very long it is a disaster it a disaster and everybody knows it and it going to die of its own weight anyway but were going to get rid of it and were going to replace it with some great great alternatives  much better health care at a much lower price hillary clinton wants to have completely governmentrun health care which would be a disaster for the liberties and freedoms of all america that what she wants that what she aiming at that what obama wanted he didnt quite get there but he got this and you see how bad this has beenone of the biggest issues in this race is going to be the issue of school choice  and i cant possibly emphasize this enough millions of poor and disadvantaged students are trapped in failing schools this education crisis afflicts all communities but none more so than the africanamerican community  none the democratic party has run the inner cities of america for 50 60 70 years some cases over a hundred years  over a hundred years their policies and their politics and in particular the politics of people like hillary clinton have produced only poverty joblessness and rising crimewhen she was running for the senate in new york state she said she was going to produce jobs jobs jobs in upstate new york it a disaster she going to produce jobs big thing  jobs were going to bring back jobs been a catastrophe weve lost tens of thousands of jobs she never did a thing it was all talk no action just like what she doing right now is all talk no action shell talk and talk and nothing will happen only bad will happen but you just have to ask the people in upstate new york she won because of them and she produced absolutely nothing jobs left it today one of the worst one of the most depressing places in this country so just remember that when you hear her talking about jobs i know jobs she doesnt know jobs that i can tell you i have outlined a new civil rights agenda for our time  the right to a safe community a great education and a secure job and i say to africanamerican parents i say to hispanic american parents  and i say it with great respect  our inner cities are a disaster  crime no jobs education is the worst in many cases almost worldwide bad and in many cases actually worldwide bad i say with great respect what do you have to lose it cant get any worse it cant get any worse you choose donald trump im going to fix the problem youre going to have safety  youre going to have good education were going to get jobs because were going to bring our jobs back mexico taking our jobs so many other places theyre taking our jobs what china doing to us is horrible were going to have jobs what do you have to lose im going to fix this im going to fix it school choice is at the center of this civil rights agenda and my goal is to provide every single innercity child in america that is trapped in a failing government school the freedom to attend the school of their choice competition  the schools the schools will get better and better and better and that means a private school a religious school a charter school or a magnet school school choice also means that parents can homeschool their children  hundred percenthillary clinton opposes school choice because she is controlled totally totally like a puppet by special interests her policies will force millions of africanamerican and hispanic children to remain stuck in failed government schools leading to higher unemployment and more poverty the poverty levels in this country nobody will believe nobody will believemy plan will break the government monopoly and make schools compete to provide the best services for our children    including every africanamerican and hispanic child in this country every single one of them this proposal begins with a 20 billion block grant from the federal government for states to pursue school choice programs  however  that good right  however because 90 percent of education spending is at the state level i will campaign to get the states to reallocate another 110 billion of their education budgets to school choice programs if we do this that would mean 12000 in school choice funds for every disadvantaged student in america what a difference this is going to make the money will follow the student to the public private or religious school that is best for them and their family in so many ways youre going to have choicemy administration will partner with the leadership of any innercity  anybody  anybody in the inner cities of america willing to run a pilot program  and there will be a lot of them  to provide school choice to every child in that community in baltimore for instance that would mean more than 15000 in funds available per studentas your president i will be the biggest cheerleader for school choice youve ever seen  this means a lot to me because i know it can turn things around again the education cant get worse commo core  were going to end it  were bringing education locali will fight for every child in this country who deserve better futures the africanamerican community has heard my message that i am going to make the inner city safe again and im going to bring back jobs and im going to bring back the great education dont be surprised  remember this november 8th  dont be surprised because we have been given a lot of support over the last three or four weeks if on november 8th i get more africanamerican and hispanic votes than anyone thought possible about a month ago you see what going on theyre starting  people are starting to hear about this and theyre saying wow wow theyre liking it and again cant get any worse it going to get a lot better but only if i do it they cant do it the democrats they have  what theyve done is incredible and hillary clinton will be absolutely more of the same  rigid itll never change remember a hundred years 70 years 50  it not going to change not going to happennow let talk about another issue that will define the future of this country for generations to come the united states supreme court  earlier this year we lost the great justice antonin scalia the next president will not only have to fill this seat but as many as four others it could even be  i mean we could end up with a total of five judges by one president it would be recordsetting probably be three could be four could even be five and you pick the wrong people you have a country that is no longer your country it will be a disasterone of the most important issues frankly  other than maybe defense because were going to build up our military it so depleted  were going to take care of our vets were going to protect your second amendment so many things but one of the most important  some people think it actually the most important  is the filling of the seats united states supreme court you see what happening right now essentially it four and four and you see what  how bad it is were going to pick great judges ive already put a list of 11 federalist society highly recommended got uniform great reviews on these 11 people and we are going to put truly great people maybe we use judge scalia of the ultimate example of what were looking for ok this will determine whether or not we remain a constitutional republic frankly that what going to happen i have pledged to appoint judges who uphold the constitution to protect your religious liberty and apply the law as written  we reject judges who rewrite the constitution to impose their own person views on 300 millionplus americans were not going to have that ive made public a list of judges as i said that will guide my selection process hillary clinton has refused to provide such a list and we brought it uplet see a list you ever saw the list you would walk out of here not feeling very well  because she knows the extremist judges she would pick would be rejected by the overwhelming majority of the american public theyd be rejected clinton judicial picks would allow her to completely take over american health care the american economy and americans religious liberty  not to mention your second amendment which is on very thin ice right now as you know because of the fact that were at fourandfour if they even pick one judge who wrong you can probably  as you know it  you can kiss the second amendment goodbye and we dont want to see thatanother issue in this race of great importance to everyone in this room is the issue of course of national security just today it was announced that north korea performed its fifth nuclear test  its fourth since hillary clinton became secretary of state it just one more massive failure from a failed secretary of state  failed at everything her policies have also put iran onto a path of nuclear weapons and i have to say made them overnight an absolute power they were dying three years ago the sanctions were choking them they would have fallen but obama didnt support people that would have taken over and i think in this case probably would have taken over the right way had no supportbut you look at what happened to iran in such a short period of time but remember the ransom payments remember it was 400 million two weeks ago but then they made a mistake this is cash remember they said they paid cash because they couldnt open a bank account there was no way of sending it into a checking account  all lies just like obamacare was a big lie remember you can use your plan you can use your doctors  27 times right twentyseven times you can use your doctors use your plan turned out to be a lie it all a lie it all a big lie it a rigged system and it a lieand ill tell you what ill tell you what the 400 million dollars for those that havent been reading the papers over the last two days turned out to be 17 billion dollars in cash  cash and i actually said  they said oh that money going to be used for terror i said no they dont need it for terror theyve got 150 billion dollars that in addition to the 150 billion that were giving back i said they dont need it this is going into their swiss accounts and going into their accounts theyre not going to use it for terror they have plenty of money for terrorthink of it  17 billion dollars in cash  massive big vats of cash you saw them  cartons i never saw anything like it ive seen a lot of cash  hey never saw anything like this  17 billion dollars can you imagine these guys planes get  they stop remember they wouldnt give back the hostages they waited there for hours and hours and obama kept saying no no this has nothing to do  even the hostages said they kept us waiting for a certain plane to come in not to take them back because they were waiting for something it was this  just another liebut can you imagine these people sitting there and they see 17 billion dollars in cash ai yai yai they think were stupid  they think were stupid they wont be thinking it for long  very sad at the same time isis is hunting down and exterminating what it calls the nation of the cross isis is carrying out a genocide against christians in the middle east we cannot let this evil continue  can t let it  isis must be destroyed  have to have no choiceto defeat isis we must use military warfare but also cyber warfare financial warfare and ideological warfare it a whole different ballgame today than it was 50 years ago and 200 years ago  different worldwe must also establish a bipartisan goal in the united states and an international goal with our allies of defeating radical islamic terrorism    words that our president wont use and words that hillary clinton wont use just like we won the cold war by identifying our enemy and building a consensus to guide a longterm strategy so too must we do the same with islamic terrorismby the way president obama has allowed syrian refugees to pour into our country at unbelievable rates and hillary clinton wants to allow 550 percent more but it almost impossible to get a christian in from syria they take others but they dont take christians  very very very rareso i said that we need to make safe zones in the region we want to take care of people but we absolutely cannot allow this potential tremendous threat to continue and we have to stop this this is going to be potentially a catastrophe for our country it from within this could be the alltime great trojan horse this could be ityou ever notice on the  you look at the migration trail and you see people with cellphones cellphones and some of the cellphones have the isis flag printed on them and some of them have things far worse than that  scenes far worse than thatso it was the failed policies you have to remember of hillary clinton and obama that unleashed isis in the first place if they did the right thing you wouldnt be talking about isis right now  now she wants to get rid of  oh were going to get rid of them you know she tells them already there will be no boots on the ground now even if you dont want boots on the ground you dont want to say it dont say it! now theyre saying oh i hope she wins oh boy would they dream of having her as president can you    they dream about it every night having hillary clinton but even if you believe  and i can understand that no boots on the ground i can understand you dont say it! let them think theyre going to go through hell dont say it! can you imagine the great general douglas macarthur can you imagine the great general george patton or one of our great generals that we have today  general flynn who here someplace    i love general flynn  but can you imagine these people saying  i mean theyre basically giving out the strategy there will be no boots on the ground if you dont want that i fully understand dont say it! dont say it! could you imagine macarthur saying were going to fight the enemy and were going to move our troops in in about a month were going to hit from behind  were going to hit them from the front then  and everything they say turns out to be true you know i hate to say this because we have a lot of evangelicals in this room but maybe we shouldnt be so honest when it comes to military strategy does that make sense  hope i didnt lose your vote for saying that just look at what her policies have left us with in iraq syria and libya the problem is hillary clinton is triggerhappy she really is she triggerhappy and yet she says no boots which is sort of  probably will be boots you know probably will turn out to be another disaster he tenure has brought us only war and destruction and death she just too quick to intervene invade or to push for regime change with people we dont even know who they are and they take over and theyre far worse this creates the power vacuums that are filled by terrorist and groups like isismy administration on the other hand will work with any country that is willing to partner with us to defeat isis and halt radical islamic terrorism and by the way that includes russia if they want to join us on knocking out isis that is just fine as far as im concerned  it a very imperfect world and you cant always choose your friends that lifebut you can never fail to recognize your enemies we have some real enemies unfortunately for our country our enemies probably hacked into hillary clinton emails these are the same emails she destroyed after receiving a federal subpoena what that using software in order to bleach the emails so you can never ever see them she even mysteriously lost 13 different phones before the fbi got them and many were destroyed with a hammer  did anybody ever hit a hammer  you know maybe two or three people but they were just released from prison those two people  can you believe this destroyed them with a hammer  the oldfashioned way i guess the other night in the commander in chief forum  did anybody see that  how did i do  good well we have a big debate coming up who knows what going to happen there but i will say every poll has me winning big league at the commander in chief  we had  the polls came out after that event and we won big league now we have a debate coming up i dont imagine any of you going to be watching the debate right i wont i promise hillary clinton answered questions on her emails horribly that why she lost that why she did so poorly she was terrible she was  honestly i shouldnt be saying this  she was terrible  she keeps talking about the emails every time she talks about them she talks about them differently  it seems each week true she has like a different answer but there can be no answer when she deletes 33000 emails bleaches them so they can never be recovered  an unheardof practice  hammers them into total silence you know what happening you know what happeningi always say getting away with that will be the single greatest accomplishment of her career  it true it true  so her answers were bad they were bad and a lot of people said they were so totally dishonest and you know she was blaming matt lauer i thought matt lauer did a very good job i mean his questions to me were very tough  but the gentleman who stood up and said honestly you should be in prison for what you did    to me that was the tough one  that was the tough  hey that was a tough question  it was sort of a question in the form of a statement right hillary clinton is unfit to be our president for many reasons  true true  she unfit for many reasons the biggest of which is her judgement it just so bad  it time to restore honestly and integrity to our government  have to do itand one more issue finally issue i want to discuss today is the economy and helping those in need there is no more charitable group in this country than christians  and all of us through  and all of us here today are determined to lift suffering americans out of poverty going to do it with a lot of other people going to help as you president i will pursue a complete reform of our economy to bring back millions of new jobs into our country  millions of new jobs  weve lost our jobs like were a bunch of babies theyve gone to other countries theyve gone to mexico theyve gone to many other countries china taking massive advantage of us it all so easy believe me it all so easythat includes we will be doing massive tax cuts for working families and for businesses  it includes very importantly the elimination of all needless jobkilling regulations  it includes lifting the restrictions on american energy which is under siege  i will also renegotiate nafta and if they dont want to renegotiate it so it becomes a twoway highway not just a oneway highway out of the united states for our companies and our jobs we will terminate nafta believe me  well stand up to china and were going to fight for every last job it going to be america first and it going to be the american worker first crucially i will also fight for the american family and american family values the family must be at the center of any antipoverty agenda has to be  thank youour country just lost one of the great champions for the american family phyllis schlafly great woman really great woman  we send our thoughts and prayers to her loved ones i will be going to her funeral tomorrow in st louis phyllis fought very hard to the very end for a free and prosperous america she understood that to be truly united as a country we cant simply turn to government or to politicians the bedrock of our unity is the realization that we are all brothers and sisters created by the same god phyllis understood that  phyllis understood thatand by the way phyllis endorsed me a long time ago when it wasnt necessarily    something that was so easy to do and she was incredible she was so brave she endorsed me and that was not the thing to do at the time people said trump she said he going to win you dont understand he knows how to win he going to win  they said phyllis not going to be trump and we went boom boom boom but i will tell you phyllis endorsed me at a time when it wasnt necessarily the thing to do even the popular thing to do and i will never forget that that had a huge impact she was a great great powerful woman with a tremendous heart and i look forward to being with her family tomorrow because you really  that a celebration she was 92 years old we are all equal and we all come from the same creator if we remember that simple fact then our future is truly limitless there is nothing we as americans cant dothere a biblical verse that i have often read and i want to repeat it again because i think it is so important to what were trying to achieve right now for our country it from 1 john chapter 4 no one has ever seen god but if we love one another god lives in us and his love is made complete in usso true  so true imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one god saluting one flag  it time to stop quibbling over the smallest words and time to start dreaming about the great adventures that lie ahead for our countrythis is my promise to all of you starting in 2017 we will be one american nation it time to break our ties with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a new american future have to do it together we will make america believe again we will make america united again and we will make america great again thank you very much and god bless you thank you  thank you thank you very much
21,thank youin 19 days we are going to win the state of ohio and we are going to win the white houseearly voting is underway so make sure to mail in your ballot or vote inpersonladies and gentlemen i want to make a major announcement today i would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters and to all of the people of the united states that i will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election  if i win!ladies and gentlemen i want to make a major announcement today i would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters and to all of the people of the united states that when the results come in on election night i will accept  without delay or hesitation  the concession speech of hillary rodham clintonnow seriously the debate last night was amazing and everybody said i won including every single online poll some by 9010the question of voter fraud came up during the debate we want fairness in the election having nothing to do with me and having to do with the future of the countryjohn podesta hillary campaign chairman was quoted in wikileaks as saying illegal immigrants could vote as long as they have drivers licensesone of the big issues that came up last night was the fact that the clinton campaign has paid people to disrupt our rallies and incite violence this is criminal behavior that violates centuries of tradition on peaceful democratic electionsa campaign like clinton that will incite violence is truly a campaign that will do anythingand a candidate like hillary clinton who will lie to the congress and the fbi destroy 33000 emails put her office up for sale and put our confidential information in reach of our enemies  is a candidate who is truly capable of anythingin addition it was just learned hillary was given the exact debate questions word for word by donna brazile  who is now under tremendous pressure to resign but i ask you why shouldnt hillary clinton resign from the race  she was given the questions used the questions and never said that she did something that was totally inappropriateyears ago there was a show called the 64000 question  he got the questions in advance his life was ruined this is even bigger because we are playing for the presidency of the united stateshillary clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the presidencyso it in that context i was asked a question about whether i would agree in advance to concede the results on election night this is an unprecedented question if al gore or george bush had agreed 3 weeks before the election to concede the results and waive their right to a legal challenge or a recount then there would be no supreme court case and no bush v gorein effect im being asked to waive centuries of legal precedent designed to protect the franchise of votersaccording to pew there are 24 million voter registrations in the united states that are either invalid or significantly inaccurate18 million dead people are registered to vote some of whom vote even though they are dead  which is a hard thing to do but easy if fraud is involved28 million people are registered in more than one stateand 14 of noncitizens are registered to voteso what im saying is we have to be vigilant and we have to be carefulamerica is a constitutional republic with a system of laws these laws are triggered in the case of fraud or in the event a recount is neededof course i would accept a clear election result but i would also reserve my right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result i will follow and abide by all of the rules and traditions of all the candidates who came before mebut none of this will matter since we are going to win big on november 8thtogether we are going to deliver real change that puts america firstwe are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals end illegal immigration stop the massive inflow of refugees reduce surging crime cut taxes and regulations unleash jobproducing american energy rebuild our military and take care of our vets and repeal and replace the disaster known as obamacareyour jobs will come back under

administrationright now our economy isnt growing at all im going to get us to 4 growth and create 25 million jobs over 10 yearsmany workers are earning less today than they were 18 years ago they are working harder and longer but making less some of them are working two three jobs but still taking home less moneycompanies like carrier are firing their workers and moving to mexico ford is moving all of its small car production to mexico when im president if companies want to fire their workers and leave for mexico then we will charge them a 35 tax when they want to ship their products back in that means the companies wont leave in the first place and if they do well at least make money when they ship their products across the borderright now our politicians dont do anything to keep our companies from leaving because they are controlled by lobbyists and special interests  hillary clinton has raised countless millions of dollars from big donors who want to ship our jobs to other countriesthat is why i am proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once againit time to drain the swamp of corruption in washington dcthose reforms include the followinga 5 yearban on executive branch and congressional officials lobbying the government after they leave government servicea lifetime ban on former executive branch officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign

deplorable and irredeemable i call you hardworking american patriots who love your country and want a better future for all of our peopleher comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as secretary of state hide and delete her emails put classified information in the reach of our enemies lie to congress and sell government favors and access through the clinton foundationit this attitude of arrogance that explains why hillary clinton made her 13 phones disappear  including with a hammer  so the fbi couldnt see them and why she bleached her emails after a congressional subpoena now the people who destroyed the emails are all pleading the fifth amendment in front of congress todayanyone watching today hearing in congress knows that hillary clinton actions are far more corrupt than we even imaginedthis is a far bigger scandal than watergate ever was but with watergate we had the justice department doing its jobs  here we dont have either this is a scandal that threatens national security and that involves a multimillion dollar payforplay scheme between the secretary of state and her foundationwhether it her emails her disasters in iraq libya and syria or her failures on the economy hillary clinton lacks the judgement temperament and moral character to lead this countryin the words of a secret service agent posted outside her office she simply lacks the integrity and the temperament to serve in the officeâfrom the bottom of my soul i know this to be truethe policies of hillary clinton have produced death and destruction overseas and produced only failing schools rising crime job loss shrinking incomes and tragic poverty at home1 in 5 american households do not have a single member in the labor

when jonathan gruber the architect of obamacare said the lack of transparency was essential to passing the legislation and then he talked about  and i quote  the stupidity of the american voter this is the hateful attitude of insiders like mr gruber and hillary clinton  and the voters have had enough theyre taking their country backanother major reform is going to be school choice ive outlined a plan to provide every disadvantaged child in america the freedom to choose the private public magnet or religious school of his or her choicethis will help lift millions of poor africanamerican and

23,thank you for the invitation to speak to you today it wonderful to be in detroitwe now begin a great national conversation about economic renewal for america it a conversation about how to make american great again for everyone and especially those who have the very leastthe city of detroit is where our story beginsdetroit was once the economic envy of the world the people of detroit helped power america to its position of global dominance in the 20th centurywhen we were governed by an america first policy detroit was booming engineers builders laborers shippers and countless others went to work each day provided for their families and lived out the american dreambut for many living in this city that dream has long ago vanishedwhen we abandoned the policy of america first we started rebuilding other countries instead of our own the skyscrapers went up in beijing and in many other cities around the world while the factories and neighborhoods crumbled in detroit our roads and bridges fell into disrepair yet we found the money to resettle millions of refugees at taxpayer expensetoday detroit has a per capita income of under 15000 dollars about half of the national average 40 percent of the city residents live in poverty over twoandhalf times the national average the unemployment rate is more than twice the national average half of all detroit residents do not workdetroit tops the list of most dangerous cities in terms of violent crimethese are the silenced victims whose stories are never told by hillary clinton but victims whose suffering is no less real or permanentin short the city of detroit is the living breathing example of my opponent failed economic agenda every policy that has failed this city and so many others is a policy supported by hillary clintonshe supports the high taxes and radical regulation that forced jobs out of your communityâand the crime policies that have made you less safeâand the immigration policies that have strained local budgetsand the trade deals like nafta signed by her husband that have shipped your jobs to mexico and other countriesâ and she supports the education policies that deny your students choice freedom and opportunityshe is the candidate of the pastours is the campaign of the futurethis is a city controlled by democratic politicians at every level and unless we change policies we will not change resultstoday i will outline my economic vision in the coming weeks we will be offering more detail on all of these policies and the ones we have already rolled out can be viewed on my campaign websiteour opposition on the other hand has long ago run out of ideas all hillary clinton has to offer is more of the same more taxes more regulations more bureaucrats more restrictions on american energy and american productionif you were a foreign power looking to weaken america you couldnt do better than hillary clinton economic agendanothing would make our foreign adversaries happier than for our country to tax and regulate our companies and our jobs out of existencethe one common feature of every hillary clinton idea is that it punishes you for working and doing business in the united states every policy she has tilts the playing field towards other countries at our expensethat why she tries to distract us with tired political rhetoric that seeks to label us divide us and pull us apartmy campaign is about reaching out to everyone as americans and returning to a government that puts the american people firsthere is what an america first economic plan looks likefirst let talk tax reformtaxes are one of the biggest differences in this racehillary clintonwho has spent her career voting for tax increasesplans another massive jobkilling 13 trilliondollar tax increase her plan would tax many small businesses by almost fifty percentrecently at a campaign event hillary clinton shortcircuited againto use a now famous termwhen she accidentally told the truth and said she wanted to raise taxes on the middle classi am proposing an acrosstheboard income tax reduction especially for middleincome americans this will lead to millions of new goodpaying jobsthe rich will pay their fair share but no one will pay so much that it destroys jobs or undermines our ability to competeas part of this reform we will eliminate the carried interest deduction and other special interest loopholes that have been so good for wall street investors and people like me but unfair to american workerstax simplification will be a major feature of the planour current tax code is so burdensome and complex that we waste 9 billion hours a year in tax code compliancemy plan will reduce the current number of brackets from 7 to 3 and dramatically streamline the process we will work with house republicans on this plan using the same brackets they have proposed 12 25 and 33 percent for many american workers their tax rate will be zerowhile we will develop our own set of assumptions and policies agreeing in some areas but not in others we will be focused on the same shared goals and guided by the same shared principles jobs growth and opportunitythese reforms will offer the biggest tax revolution since the reagan tax reform which unleashed years of continued economic growth and job creationwe will make america grow againin the days ahead we will provide more details on this plan and how it will help you and your family it will present a nightandday contrast to the jobkilling taxraising povertyinducing obamaclinton agendathe state of new york has already lived through hillary clinton failed leadership the washington post just published a devastating article on hillary clinton broken promises she pledged 200000 jobs for upstate new york as senator but what happened the washington post writes and i quote upstate job growth stagnated overall during her tenure with manufacturing jobs plunging nearly 25 percentâthe former first lady was unable to pass big ticket legislationâ many promised jobs never materialized and others migrated to other states as she turned to her first presidential runâdata shows that upstate actually lost jobs during clinton first termcompare that to my record in a recent new york post article by steve cuozzo how donald trump helped save new york city the paper writes that iand this is a direct quotewaded into a landscape of empty fifth avenue storefronts the dustbowl mugging ground that was central park and a wall street area seemingly on its last legs as companies moved outâalmost by force of will   rode to the rescue expressing rare faith in the future he was instrumental in kickstarting the regeneration of neighborhoods and landmarks almost given up for deadthis is what i want to do for our countryi want to jumpstart americanow let look at what the obamaclinton policies have done nationallytheir policies produced 12 growth the weakest socalled recovery since the great depression and a doubling of the national debtthere are now 943 million americans outside the labor force it was 805 million when president obama took office an increase of nearly 14 million peoplethe obamaclinton agenda of tax spend and regulate has created a silent nation of jobless americanshome ownership is at its lowest rate in 51 yearsnearly 12 million have been added to the food stamp rolls since president obama took office another nearly 7 million americans were added to the ranks of those in povertywe have the lowest labor force participation rates in four decades58 percent of africanamerican youth are either outside the labor force or not employed1 in 5 american households do not have a single member in the labor force these are the real unemployment numbersthe five percent figure is one of the biggest hoaxes in modern politicsmeanwhile american households are earning more than 4000 less today than they were sixteen years agothe average worker today pays 315 percent of their wages to income and payroll taxes on top of that state and local taxes consume another 10 percentthe united states also has the highest business tax rate among the major industrialized nations of the world at 35 percent it almost 40 percent when you add in taxes at the state levelin other words we punish companies for making products in americabut let them ship products into the us taxfree if they move overseasthis is backwards all of our policies should be geared towards keeping jobs and wealth inside the united statesunder my plan no american company will pay more than 15 of their business income in taxes small businesses will benefit the most from this plan hillary clinton plan will require small business to pay as much as three times more in taxes than what i am proposing and her onerous regulations will put them totally out of business i am going to cut regulations massivelyour lower business tax will also end jobkilling corporate inversions and cause trillions in new dollars and wealth to come pouring into our countryand into cities like detroit to help unleash this new job creation we will allow businesses to immediately expense new business investmentsno one will gain more from these proposals than lowandmiddle income americansmy plan will also help reduce the cost of childcare by allowing parents to fully deduct the average cost of childcare spending from their taxeswe are also going to bring back trillions of dollars from american businesses that is now parked overseas our plan will bring that cash home applying a 10 percent tax this money will be reinvested in states like michiganfinally no family will have to pay the death tax american workers have paid taxes their whole lives and they should not be taxed again at deathit just plain wrong we will repeal itnext comes regulatory reformas with taxes i will have one overriding goal when it comes to regulation i want to keep jobs and wealth in americamotor vehicle manufacturing is one of the most heavily regulated industries in the country the us economy today is twentyfive percent smaller than it would have been without the surge of regulations since 1980it is estimated that current overregulation is costing our economy as much as 2 trillion dollars a yearthat money taken straight out of cities like yoursthe federal register is now over 80000 pages long as the wall street journal noted president obama has issued close to four hundred new major regulations since taking office each with a cost to the american economy of 100 million or morein 2015 alone the obama administration unilaterally issued more than 2000 new regulationseach a hidden tax on american consumers and a massive lead weight on the american economyit is time to remove the anchor dragging us downupon taking office i will issue a temporary moratorium on new agency regulations my running mate mike pence signed a similar order when he became governor of indiana this will give our american companies the certainty they need to reinvest in our community get cash off of the sidelines start hiring for new jobs and expanding businessesi will also immediately cancel all illegal and overreaching executive ordersnext i will ask each and every federal agency to prepare a list of all of the regulations they impose on americans which are not necessary do not improve public safety and which needlessly kill jobs those regulations will be eliminatedwe are in a competition with the world and i want america to win when i am president we willone of the most important reforms of all is trade reformas bernie sanders has said hillary clinton has bad judgment weve seen this bad judgment overseas in libya iraq and syria weve seen it in iran weve seen it from president obama when he gives 150 billion to iran the number one terror state and even gives them 400 million in moneylaundered cash as a ransom paymentbut weve also seen the terrible obamaclinton judgment right here in detroithillary clinton has supported the trade deals stripping this city and this country of its jobs and wealthshe supported bill clinton nafta she supported china entrance into the world trade organization she supported the jobkilling trade deal with south korea and she supports the transpacific partnershiplet talk about south korea for a moment because it so perfectly illustrates the broken promises that have hurt so many american workerspresident obama and the usual socalled experts whove been wrong about every trade deal for decades predicted that the trade deal with south korea would increase our exports to south korea by more than 10 billionresulting in some 70000 jobslike hillary clinton broken promises to new york these pledges all turned out to be false instead of creating 70000 jobs it has killed nearly 100000 according to the economic policy institute our exports to south korea havent increased at all but their imports to us have surged more than 15 billionmore than doubling our trade deficit with that countrythe next betrayal will be the transpacific partnership hillary clinton closest friend terry mcauliffe confirmed what i have said on this from the beginning if sent to the oval office hillary clinton will enact the tpp guaranteed her donors will make sure of ita vote for hillary clinton is a vote for tppand it also a vote for naftaour annual trade deficit in goods with mexico has risen from close to zero in 1993 to almost 60 billion our total trade deficit in goods hit nearly 800 billion last yearthis is a strike at the heart of michigan and our nation as a wholeaccording to the bureau of labor statistics before nafta went into effect there were 285000 auto workers in michigan today that number is only 160000detroit is still waiting for hillary clinton apology i expect detroit will get that apology right around the same time hillary clinton turns over the 33000 emails she deletedhillary clinton transpacific partnership tpp will be an even bigger disaster for the auto industry in fact ford motor company has announced its opposition to the dealaccording to the economic policy institute the us trade deficit with the proposed tpp member countries cost over 1 million manufacturing jobs in 2015by far the biggest losses occurred in motor vehicles and parts which lost nearly 740000 manufacturing jobsmichigan ranks first for jobs lost as a share of state workforce due to the trade deficit with tpp membersjust imagine how many more automobile jobs will be lost if the tpp is actually approved that is why i have announced we will withdraw from the deal before that can ever happen hillary clinton will never withdraw from the tpp she is bought controlled and paidfor by her donors and special interestsbecause my only interest is the american people i have previously laid out a detailed 7point plan for trade reform available on my website it includes strong protections against currency manipulation tariffs against any countries that cheat by unfairly subsidizing their goods and it includes a renegotiation of nafta if we dont get a better deal we will walk awayat the center of my plan is trade enforcement with china this alone could return millions of jobs into our economychina is responsible for nearly half of our entire trade deficit they break the rules in every way imaginable china engages in illegal export subsidies prohibited currency manipulation and rampant theft of intellectual property they also have no real environmental or labor protections further undercutting american workersjust enforcing intellectual property rules alone could save millions of american jobs according to the us international trade commission improved protection of america intellectual property in china would produce more than 2 million more jobs right here in the united statesadd to that the saved jobs from cracking down on currency cheating and product dumping and we will bring trillions of dollars in new wealth and wages back to the united statestrade has big benefits and i am in favor of trade but i want great trade deals for our country that create more jobs and higher wages for american workers isolation is not an option only great and wellcrafted trade deals arealso critical to our economic renewal will be energy reformthe obamaclinton administration has blocked and destroyed millions of jobs through their antienergy regulations while raising the price of electricity for both families and businessesas a result of recent obama epa actions coalfired power plants across michigan have either shut down entirely or undergone expensive conversions the obamaclinton war on coal has cost michigan over 50000 jobs hillary clinton says her plan will put a lot of coal companies and coal miners out of businesswe will put our coal miners and steel workers back to workclinton not only embraces president obama jobkilling energy restrictions but wants to expand them including going after oil and natural gas production that employs some 10 million americansaccording to the heritage foundation by 2030 the obamaclinton energy restrictions will eliminate another half a million manufacturing jobs reduce economic output by 25 trillion dollars and reduce incomes by 7000 dollars per persona trump administration will end this war on the american worker and unleash an energy revolution that will bring vast new wealth to our countryaccording to the institute for energy research lifting the restrictions on all sources of american energy willincrease gdp by more than 100 billion dollars annually add over 500000 new jobs annually and increase annual wages by more than 30 billion dollars over the next 7 yearsincrease federal state and local tax revenues by almost 6 trillion dollars over 4 decadesincrease totaleconomic activity by more than 20 trillion dollars over the next 40 yearsthe reforms i have outlined today are only the beginningwhen we reform our tax trade energy and regulatory policies we will open a new chapter in american prosperitywe can use this new wealth to rebuild our military and our infrastructureas part of this new future we will also be rolling out proposals to increase choice and reduce cost in childcare offering muchneeded relief to american families i will unveil my plan on this in the coming weeks that i have been working on with my daughter ivanka and an incredible team of expertslikewise our education reforms will help parents send their kids to a school of their choicewe will also give our police and law enforcement the funds and support they need to restore law and order to this country without security there can be no prosperity we must have law and orderin the coming days we will be rolling out plans on all of these items one of my first acts as president will be to repeal and replace disastrous obamacare saving another 2 million american jobswe will also rebuild our military and get our allies to pay their fair share for the protection we providesaving us

24,thank you that so nice thank youwell that so nice and bishop jackson i want to thank you and dr jackson and you have some voice i have to say incredible and some spirit some spirit talentthank you well i just wrote this the other day knowing id be here and i mean it from the heart and id like to just read it and i think youll understand it maybe better than i do in certain waysfor centuries the africanamerican church has been the conscience of our country so true it from the pews and pulpits and christian teachings of black churches all across this land that the civil rights movement lifted up its soul and lifted up the soul of our nation it from these pews that our nation has been inspired toward a better moral character a deeper concern for mankind and spirit of charity and unity that binds us all together and were bound together and i see that today this has been an amazing day for methe africanamerican faith community has been one of god greatest gifts to america and to its people there is perhaps no action our leaders can take that would do more to heal our country and support our people than to provide a greater platform to the black churches and churchgoers you do right everyday by your community and your families you raise children in the light of god i will always support your church always and defend your right to worship    so importanti am here today to listen to your message and i hope that my presence here will also help your voice to reach new audiences in our country and many of these audiences desperately need your spirit and your thought i can tell you thatchristian faith is not the past but the present and the future make it stronger and well open it up to great great leaders like pastor jackson bishop jackson dr jackson and so many others and so many others actually sitting here darrell scott who is phenomenal who has been with me for so long so long omrosea who is a very nice person and i dont want to say that because ill destroy her image by saying that she actually a very very fine person and pastor and i want to thank all the folks and there is somebody that been very special to me dr ben carson who been    stand up ben come here come here come here ben this is a great man and great guyso as i prepare to campaign all across the nation and in every community i will have an opportunity to lay out my plans for economic change which will be so good for detroit and so good for this community because were going to bring jobs back i will have a chance    thank you were bringing them back were taking them from mexico and everywhere else because theyre gonei will have a chance to discuss school choice its very important and how to put every american on the ladder of success a great education a great job but today i just want to let you know that i am here to listen to you and i have been doing that and we had a fantastic interview with bishop jackson it was really an amazing interview he is better than the people who do that professionally i will tell you it true it true it true he betterand i didnt really know what i was getting into i didnt know is this going to be nice is this going to be wild he a great gentleman and a very smart guy i just hope you dont lose him to hollywood that the only problem and especially and especially dr jackson she may be gone hollywood is calling look at all those television cameras back there look at all the television cameras im sorry to do that to you bishop because it just one of those things rightour nation is too divided we talk past each other not to each other and those who seek office do not do enough to step into the community and learn what is going on they dont know they have no clue im here today to learn so that we can together remedy injustice in any form and so that we can also remedy economics so that the africanamerican community can benefit economically through jobs and income and so many other different waysour political system has failed the people and works only to enrich itself i want to reform that system so that it works for you everyone in this room i believe true reform can only come from outside the system i really mean that being a businessman is much different than being a politician because i understand what is happening and we are going outside the establishmentbecoming the nominee of the party of abraham lincoln  a lot of people dont realize that abraham lincoln the great abraham lincoln was a republican  has been the greatest honor of my life it is on his legacy that i hope to build the future of the party but more important the future of the country and the communityi believe that we need a civil rights agenda for our time one that ensures the rights to a great education  so important  and the right to live in safety and in peace and to have a really really great job a good paying job and one that you love going to every morning that can happen we need to bring our companies backit also means the right to have a government that protects our works and fights really fights for our jobs i want to help you build and rebuild detroit and we can do that especially with people like bishop jackson and dr jackson i mean that it been an amazing experience it been an amazing experience reallynothing is more sad than when we sideline young black men with unfulfilled potential tremendous potential i met some people this morning that are incredible people and theyre looking for jobs these are incredible people    young people our whole country loses out when were unable to harness the brilliance and the energy of these folkswere one nation and when anyone hurts we all hurt together that is so true so truewere all brothers and sisters and were all created by the same god we must love each other and support each other and we are in this all together all togetheri fully understand that the africanamerican community has suffered from discrimination and that there are many wrongs that must still be made right and they will be right i want america prosperous for everyone i want to make this city the economic envy of the world and we can do that we can do that againfactories everywhere new roads and bridges new schools  especially schools  and new hopei have been so greatly blessed and in so many ways with no greater blessing than my family ive had a great familynothing would make me happier and more fulfilled than to use what i have learned in business and in traveling all over the world  ive sort of seen a lot  to bring the wealth and prosperity and opportunity to those who have not had these opportunities before and that many many people in detroitwhen i see wages falling people out of work i know the hardships this inflicts and i am determined to do something about it i will do something about it i do get things done i will tell you some people have strengths that one of my strengths i get things done im going to get things done

win again for all of our people i want to work with you to renew the bonds of trust between citizens and the bonds of faith that make our nation strong america has been lifted out of many of its most difficult hours through the miracle of faith and through people like bishop jackson and dr jackson so important people have no idea how important they arenow in these hard times for our country let us turn again to our christian heritage to lift up the soul of our nation i am so deeply grateful to be here today and it is my prayer that the america of tomorrow  and i mean that  that the america of tomorrow will be one of unity togetherness and peace and perhaps we can add the word prosperity ok prosperityid like to conclude with a passage from 1 john chapter 4 you know it see most groups i

be with you in my vision i saw not only the suffering of our people but also their strength courage and really unbeatable spirit their spirit will overcome we have a lot to overcome in our country especially the fact that our jobs are being taken away from us and going to other lands and were not going to allow it to happen and especially it happening right here in michigan it an amazing spirit that we will need to rebuild our country it that strength that were going to need to create the new american future our children so much deserve in this new  thank you thank you very much in this new future millions of workers on the sidelines will be returned to the work force and if im not elected president that will never happen believe me theyre talking to you theyre playing you but believe me you know the answerand i have to say that ive been talking about michigan and the car industry and how your businesses and plants have been ripped out of your land and i have been doing it for four years to the people of michigan other people started talking about it last week theyre not going to do anything about itcrumbling roads bridges and airports will be replaced with the infrastructure our country needs and deserves families strapped in welfare will be provided with jobs and opportunity children stuck in failing government schools will be able to attend the school of their choice government will become lean effective responsible and honest our border will be protected and our children will be safe very very safe and we will build the wall dont worry about it we will build the wall law and order will be restored and the poorest places in our country will know safety and peace again american values and cultures will be cherished  and i mean cherished and celebrated once again but to achieve this new american future we must break free from the bitter failures of the past and reject the same insiders telling us the same old lies over and over and over again no group in america has been more harmed by hillary clinton policies than africanamericans no group no group if hillary clinton goal was to inflict pain on the africanamerican community she could not have done a better job it is a disgrace tonight im asking for the vote of every single africanamerican citizen in this country who wants to see a better future the inner cities of our country have been run by the democratic party for more than 50 years their policies have produced only poverty joblessness failing schools and broken homes it time to hold democratic politicians accountable for what they have done to these communities at what point do we say enough at what point do we say enough it is time to hold failed leaders accountable for their results not just their empty words over and over again look at what the democratic party has done to the city as an example and there are many others of detroit 40 percent of detroit residents 40 percent live in poverty half of all detroit residents do not work and cannot work and cant get a jobdetroit tops the list of most dangerous cities in terms of violent crime number one this is the legacy of the democratic politicians who have run this city this is the result of the policy agenda embraced by crooked hillary clinton 33000 emails gone the only way to change results is to change leadership we can never fix our problems by relying on the same politicians who created our problems in the first place a new future requires brand new leadership look at how much africanamerican communities are suffering from democratic control to those i say the following what do you have to lose by trying something new like trump what do you have to lose i say it again what do you have to lose look youre living in poverty your schools are no good you have no jobs 58 of your youth is unemployed what the hell do you have to loseand at the end of four years i guarantee you that i will get over 95 of the african american vote i promise you because i will produce i will produce for the inner cities and i will produce for the african americans and the democrats will not produce and all they have done is taken advantage of your vote that all theyve done and once the election is over they go back to their palaces in washington and you know what they do nothing for you just remember itso you have nothing to lose one thing we know for sure if you keep voting for the same people you will keep getting the same exactly the same resultsmy administration will go to work for you as no one has ever done beforewe will work we will bring back jobs we will workby contrast the one thing every item in hillary clinton agenda has in common is that it takes jobs and opportunities away from african american workersit takes jobs away from all workers because your companies are leaving michigan your companies are leaving every single state in our union theyre going to mexico theyre going everywhere but herehillary clinton supports open borders which means many things but it means people pouring and they take your jobswhether you like it or dont like it they take your jobsher fierce opposition to school choice you need choice you have to get your children into good schools you do that through competition you need choiceher plan to massively raise taxes on small business and everyone 13 trillion tax increase where as i am cutting taxes very substantively for business and for the middle classher tremendous opposition to american energy her opposition is fierce and her record of giving our jobs away to many many other countries america must reject the bigot dream of hillary clinton who sees communities of color only as votes not as human beings worthy of a better futurehillary clinton would rather provide a job to a refugee from overseas that to give that job to unemployed african american youth in cities like detroit who have become refugees in their own countryit time to get our country back to work and that includes an all out effort to help young african americans get the good paying jobs that they deservehillary clinton plan would bring in an estimated 620000 refugees in her first term at a lifetime benefit cost of some 400 billion to our country according to the senate immigration subcommitteehillary clinton wants to be america angela merkel by the way for the price of supporting one refugee in the united states we could support 12 in a safe zone in the middle east or let say syriathe approved refugee screening standards that i have proposed will save countless billions of dollars it called extreme vetting extreme vetting we will invest a portion of the money saved in the jobs program for inner city youth the african american community has given so much to this country they fought and died in every war since the revolutiontheyve lifted up the conscience of our nation in the long march towards civil rights theyve sacrificed so much for the national good yet nearly 4 in 10 african americans children still live in poverty and 58 as i said of african americans are not workingthey cannot find a jobwe must do better as a country i refuse to believe that the future must be like the past it wont be our future will be a great future for everyone for everyone in a trump administration all workers of all colors will get priorities for jobs in their own country which is about timei want higher wages for african americans for hispanic americans and for all americans we want higher wages many many workers in our country are making substantially less money today in real wages than they made 18 years agotheyre working two jobs instead of one theyre working much harder as they get older and it supposed to be the oppositewere gonna stop it were going to create great jobs and were gonna get the wages uphillary clinton is a throwback to an ugly past where politicians preyed on our poorest citizens while selling them out for personal gain promises promises all talk no action all talk no action politiciansthey talk talk talk you vote them in with great fan fare and then they just do nothingwith trump that is not going to happen believe mewe must turn the page on yesterday only a change in leadership will produce a change in outcomes and we cant take as a country four more years of obama and that what you get with hillary clinton but probably worsein this new american future american workers will always come first america first always come firstthis will include a complete revitalization of the michigan manufacturing sector now you have to understand the michigan manufacturing sector is a disaster is a disasterlook at your notes look at your stats look at what happening to your state youre losing your businesses it like taking candy away from a baby and many people right now in this audience that think you have jobs youre gonna find out very soon that your company is leaving from mexico or some other place and youre not going to have your job for very longand if trump gets in those days are over folks theyre over we will be brining back our jobs to michigan there will be a very big price to pay for those companies that wanna leave our land go someplace else manufacture their goods and sell back with no retributionit wont happen there will be consequence wont happen it will not happenmichigan lost more than 1 in 4 of its manufacturing jobs since naftaas you know nafta one of the worst trade bills in history maybe maybe the worst trade bill signed in the history of the world not only in our country its emptied out michigan its emptied out new england its emptied out new york state its emptied out so many of our great companiesthey leave and they fire we end up with devastation we end up with unemployment we end up with nothingthe bill was signed by bill clinton it was supported by hillary clinton right here in this community you have lost 1 in 7 manufacturing jobs since bill clinton put china into the world trade organization another hillary clinton back deal she backs all the dealsand by the way she will be backing trans pacific partnership tpp if she is elected just mark your words just remember you know it gonna happenshe considered it the gold standard all of a sudden when she heard me talking about it she said i cant win this one so she went against it she will go back immediately and you saw that when the governor of virginia who her friend said that was going to happendetroit lost more than 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs following the nafta and wto agreements that was supported very strongly by my opponentno industry has been hurt more by hillary clinton policies than the automobile industry or as we call it the car industry it has been a total disasteraccording to the bureau of the labor of statistics before nafta went into effect there were 285000 auto workers in michigan today that number is down to only 160000 and it is going to be a lot lower because if you look at the massive plants being built right now in mexico car plants folks you can kiss these jobs goodbye but not me not with me it wont happen in 2014 general motors announced plans to double its investments in mexico by plans by 2018 not good in april 2016 ford motor company announced plans to invest another 16 billion constructing an auto plant in mexico mexico will become the car capital of the world very very quickly and michigan is going to end up with lots of empty buildings all over the place unless you elect donald trump president in which case it not gonna happen in same month fiat chrysler announced 1300 layoffs the list goes on and on we will turn it around we will turn it around fast we will meet with these companies and we will say it will not be easy for you to move your plant to mexico for you sell your cars through what will be a very strong border and for you not to pay tax on those cars coming in okay and when we tell them that there will be a substantial tax on the cars that they make in mexico and other places number one theyre not going to move in the first place and number two if they do our country will make one heck of a lot of money but to save your jobs and do all of the things that im talking about we have to win on november 8th the destruction that nafta started will be finished off if the transpacific partnership is approved it will be almost nothing is as bad as nafta but it will be almost as bad as naftawe know from hillary closest friend that she is planning to ram through tpp if she elected she even called it as i said the gold standard its passage would be a disaster for michigan in particular for the car industry in particular for the people of michigan i wont let it happen according to the economic policy institute the united states trade deficit with the proposed tpp member countries cost over one million manufacturing jobs in our country in 2015 by far the biggest losses occurred in motor vehicles and parks which lost nearly 740000 think of that 740000 manufacturing jobs michigan ranks first for jobs lost as a share of state workforce due to trade deficit with tpp membersjust imagine how many more automobile jobs will be lost if hillary gets her wish and approves tpp it will not be pretty that why i have announced that we will withdrawal from the deal before that deal can ever ever ever happen i have have previously laid out a detailed sevenpoint plan for trade reform available on my website it includes strong protections against currency manipulation from countries like china and tariffs against any nation that cheats by unfairly subsidizing their goods of which many of them do my plan also includes a total renegotiation of nafta so our jobs can come back and if we cant make a much much better deal than we have right now we will walk im not in any way shape or form an isolationist i dont believe in it but we have to make great deals for our country were losing in our whole trade negotiation with all countries over 800 billion a year that our trade deficit who negotiates these deals we want great trade deals and we will have them but we want trade deals that work for america that create jobs and wealth for our country that work for the american worker we want to shrink our almost 800 billion trade deficit we dont want to expand it and it been expanding for years for years and years you look at the charts up up up up up and i say to myself so often why dont they do something about it and the reason is we have political hacks as our negotiatorswe have politicians as our negotiators we have politicians that are controlled like hillary clinton by her donors her special interests and her lobbyists and they wont let her do what right for our workers and for our countrywe want to be leading the world in production exports and manufacturing we want jobs to leave from other countries and come into our country for a change another major issue in this race is foreign policy hillary clinton has made one bad foreign policy decision after another beginning with the support for going to war in iraq and i opposed it so stronglynobody cared i was a civilian but i opposed it i said you will have a total destabilization of the middle east it was such common sense and look what happened her tenure as secretary of state may be regarded as the most disastrous in united states history but she is totally without remorse her failed decisions as secretary of state unleashed isis onto the world but has she ever apologized for the death and destruction she has caused nolook at the world before and after she became secretary of state prehillary in the early 2009s iraq was seeing a reduction in violence libya was somewhat stable syria was under control the group we now know today isis was close to being extinguished iran was being choked by sanctionsnow take a look at what we have fast forward to the present timeafter hillary here is what it looks like iraq is in total chaos syria is in the midst of a disastrous civil war a refugee crisis now threatens europe and the united states where were taking in thousands and thousands and thousands of people isis has been unleashed unto the entire worldiran the world top state sponsor of terrorism has been put on the path to nuclear weapons was given 400 million in ransom payment cash very much like you can keep your doctor you can keep your plan obamacare a total disaster it will be repealed it will be replaced hillary clinton is a legacy of death destruction and terrorism america deserves a better legacyall of you deserve a much much better futurei am the change agent i am the change agent i am your messenger and i said it many times im nothing more than your messenger it a message of strong defense common sense take care of our vets great education get rid of common core great health care get rid of obamacare save our second amendment which is under tremendous siege right nowhillary clinton is the defender of the status quo or what we have while our country lost badly under hillary clinton she cashed in big time our country was losing our people were losing but she is cashing inbill clinton speaking fees surged while hillary was secretary of state he was paid almost 50 million for speeches during her tenure an increase in 44 percent over the previous four yearsby the way things came out today that blow everything away today then there was all of the money funneled into the clinton foundation from foreign governments and corporations it was pay for play yet hillary clinton who is indifferent to the suffering she has caused has no remorse at all she offers no apologies no apologies for unleashing isis no apologies for her open borders no apologies for lying about her emails or about benghazi the only way to learn the full depth of her public corruption is to read the 33000 emails that she deletedand the only way to get justice in this rigged system is to show up and vote on november 8th and vote big big big and i will bring your jobs back so are you ready to voteand what about your future is it going to be great good or terriblegreat so if youre ready to vote for honest government and the honest government that you deserve a trump administration will end the corruption and restore integrity to government service remember im funding my campaign im spending tremendous amounts of money on running for officeim raising money for the republican party and the republican national committee which i think is doing a very good job but ill tell you more about that on november 8th ill let you know if they do a good job or if they do not such a good job but i think theyre going to do a great jobno one will be above the law in a trump administration the state department will work for the country not for hillary clinton donors and i will work for you and i will work for no one else i will work for you i will never lie to you i will never put any other interests before you and i will never ever stop fighting for you never the government will work for the people again that means we are only going to admit individuals into our country who support our values and were not going to issue visas where adequate screening controls take place we are going to make sure that we have total screening and without it we cannot continue to have our government run like this we will also seek to join in partnership with any nation that wishes to join us in defeating and destroying isis at home taxes will go down especially for look i mean it going to go down for a lot of people for business theyre going down businesses are going to flourish theyre going to come pouring back but taxes will go down especially for middleincome americans and small business rates will be lowered to 15 percent so we can put millions of new jobs into our poorest neighborhoods as i said obamacare will be repealed and replaced voters not special interests will be in charge finally we are going to bring our country together again we have a divided country it totally divided the era of division will be replaced with a future of unity total unity we will love each other we will have one county everybody will work together we are going to do it by emphasizing what we all have in common as americans it time to break with the failures of the past and to fight for every last child in this country to have the better future they deserve in my administration every american will be treated equally protected equally and honored equally we will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms and seek a new future built on our common culture and values as one american people this is the change i am promising to all of you an honest government with low taxes a thriving economy and a just society for each and every american it time to vote for a new american future together we will make america wealthy again we will make america united again we will make america proud again we will make america safe again and we will make america great again god bless you thank you thank you very much michigan thank you
26,thank you thank you everybody thank you unbelievable thank you very much thank you very much it a great honor thank you amazing amazing what great peoplewere going to bring back our jobs to pennsylvania were going to bring back our jobs to the united states going to bring back our jobs folks ive looked at the numbers and i see what happening in pennsylvania i see what happening all over our countryyou look at new york state you look at new england you look anywhere in the country where you want to go to all over it the same manufacturing way down jobs way down you go to other countries theyre taking our companies theyre taking our jobspeople are right now working harder than theyve ever worked eighteen years ago they made more money in real wages 18 years think of it eighteen years ago many of the people in this incredibly big room and thank you for being here you know it 93 degrees out and they still have a lot of people trying to get in i dont know if they can get them in should we let them in just let them in but 18 years ago people were making more money in real wages than they make today and today theyre working two jobs some people are working three jobs so theyre older and theyre working harder and theyre making less money all right a friend of mine ive been telling this story over the last month because it better than going to wharton or better than going to harvard and asking them to do a study because you learn it in three minutesbut let me just tell you right now mexico and other countries are building facilities plants the likes of which youve never seen were going to build the wall dont worry were going to build the wall were going to build it were going to build it but a friend of mine and actually a supporter big supporter great guy he builds plants that what he does he builds plants he doesnt want to build apartments he doesnt want to build office buildings he wants to build plants and he just about the biggest there is and i said how are things going he said very well how are you doing in the us not good how are you doing in mexicohe said donald do you want to see it the eighth wonder of the world they are building plants the likes of which ive never seen he building some of the greatest plants bigyou look at ford moving vast operations to mexico the plants you look atlook at take a look by the way millions of jobs thousands of companies over the years theyve left us and we have a few things we have unemployment we have empty plants i saw up in new york state i saw it in pennsylvania you were great to meet you voted a big victory for donald trump thank you that was a big victory i mean i assumed i was goingif i dont win pennsylvaniaand by the way i was talking to our great congressman and where is he he here some place where is he he loves the people and i have to say of all of pennsylvania he wants to see this state do well thank you but just talking back to a few of my friends that live here we have a few of the friends and we see what happened with general electric where theyre cutting way back not going to happen and you know why theyre cutting back it one reason because we dont take care of our miners and were not producing coaland they dont need to make those big big beautiful you could call them locomotives i guess right whatever the hell they are theyre big and theyre powerful and they dont need them like they used to because we dont make our government work for us theyre not working for us theyre working for others theyre not working for us so when general electric goes out and you see the numbers i see the numbers and it about coal so i just left parts of virginia and west virginia and the coal industry decimatedthe miners are out of work theyre totally out of work i mean there will be no such thing as coal in this country pretty soon and were talking clean coal were talking clean coalso i was with the miners we have such tremendous support west virginia the mining parts of virginia all over ohio because hillary clinton made the statement not so long ago a number of months she said were going to put the mines and miners out of business all right going to put the mines and the miners  so so were not going to let that happen were not going to let that happen and were not going to let it happen in pennsylvania because you know what a lot of your miners have already lost their jobs but you have a lot of other jobs that are very reliant on the mines like as an example general electric and what were going to do folks is going to be so special were going to bring it back were going to bring back our jobs were going to bring back our companies when a company wants to leave our country to go to another country and think theyre going to make their product and because our politicians are weak stupid taken care of by lobbyists special intereststheyre taken care of by lobbyists theyre taken care of by donors and special interests that whatyou know a friend of minevery smart guysaidi cant believe it were talking about a deal that took place about a month agohe said i cant believe they could have gotten that through i said why cant you believe it well it so bad for the country i said yeah but it good for the politician because theyre taken care of by their lobbyists and their donors and the special interestsso even though you say we want as an example general electric to produce more if they dont want to or if for some reason one of the donors of crooked hillary clinton doesnt want that to happen even though it great for erie even though it great you even though it great for the state of pennsylvania then it not going to happen folks it not going to happenand by the wayand i have to tell you this so when they think theyre going to take our companies are rip them out ofas an examplethis area or this state or any other state and go to mexico and build massive new plants and employ people other than you and youre going to lose your jobs or youre going to now get two part time jobs that dont add up to half of what you used to make that stuff isnt happening anymore so here what happens theyre going to build that plant now if i were here five years ago and if president obama put me and maybe secretary of keeping business in the united statesthat my title secretary of keeping business in the united states i mean i like the sound of secretary of defense better oh and by the way were going to build our military were going to be very strong really and were going to take care of our vets were going to take care of our vets believe me but i like the soundi like the sound of secretary of defense i like the sound of secretary of the treasury i like the sound of secretary of state but ill tell you would i be good at keeping jobs over here would i be ill tell you this i just have to say the bernie sanders protesters were much much stronger they had much more passion i have to say all right you know what interesting if i could speak to them for like five minuteswe want a strong military we want to take care of our people we want good education we want good housing we want good healthcare what do we want were all in for the same thing really amazing really amazing so ill be your secretary of keeping companies in the united states right so i would go to a company like carrier air conditioner which decided to leave indianapolis indiana and i would say here the storywe think it wonderful that youre negotiating with mexico im sure youre going to have a wonderful plant but here what going to happen if you build that plant and you fire all of these people 1400 people who were so great to meindiana i won that in a landslide actually the timing was good i won it in a landslide because i know what to do hillary doesnt know what to do did you see her yesterday she has no clue about what were talking about folks she has no clue she has no clue crooked hillary she doesnt know anything about it and by the way if she did she couldnt do it anyway because her donors dont want to do it there reasonsbut look look i would go to them and say just to keep them just to keep them and i wouldnt even care that much ill tell you why ready id say here the storyif you leave in this case indianapolis youre going to go to mexico youre going to make your air conditioning units every single unit that you make that crosses our now very very strong border were going to charge you 35 percent of the cost of that unit ok thirty five percent rightso simple thirty five percent the cost of that unit we hope you enjoy your new plant very hot weather out there very hot we hope you enjoy your new plant but 35 percent is coming to us now here what going to happen if they havent moved yet a lot of them have movedweve lost thousands and thousands of companies weve lost millions of jobs  too late i should have been there 10 years ago nobody would have left nobody would have left because you need the right messenger you know im your messenger in terms of this movementbut you need the right person saying it so here what going to happen normally theyd call up whoever it is that was putting the little order down like the new president and theyd have one of their lobbyists call up and theyd say hillary im sorry you cant do that they gave you 2 million for your campaign cant do that hillary ok i wont do thatwith me im putting my money up folks im putting my money up putting my money up were raising money for reince and for the rnc but that for a lot of other reasons we are putting  im putting a lot of money up i financed my  i funded not financed i wish i financed right i funded but i funded my primaries and i spent less than anybody else in terms of the measures so here a story  wouldnt that be nicei spent less and won in a landslide other people spent much much more three four five times more and they came in seventh who the hell do you want to have as your president right right right oh boy and then they dont like me  couple of them most of them have really supported us but some of them just cant get over it you know what i say to them get over it were just having fun get over ityou signed a pledge i hereby guarantee that i will endorse whoever wins  you know the funny thing all those pledges you know they were signed for different  they were signed so that i would sign it and i would have honored it i will say even if i wasnt fond or didnt like  i would have honored it because a pledge is a very important thing but here the thing so we are going to take these companies that havent left  now im looking at your numbers folks youre not doing too wellyoure not doing too well here pennsylvania has lost one in three manufacturing jobs since  you know that massive since nafta nafta was signed by bill clinton and i believe it the single worst trade document ever signed in the history of our country and probably in the history of our worldit one of the most onesided documents that ive ever seen and it allowed mexico and places to do unbelievably well at our expense and did you see where say im going to renegotiate nafta im going totpp disaster ok dont worry dont worryand hillary was in favor of tpp she said it the gold standard thank you for reminding me i like this guy it the gold standard tpp transpacific partnership it is going to bei dont think you can be worse than nafta honestly but it going to be as bad as nafta so tpp she said it is the gold standard she reading it from a teleprompter it is the gold standardoh boy our country is in trouble our country is in trouble our country is in troubleso she said it the gold standard but when she heard me make a speech as i understand it and she heard me talking very negatively about it as an example they dont talk devaluation which is the single greatest tool that these countries are using to kill the united states including china they devalue their currency well it doesnt happen number one thing is not mentionedso complicated this agreement too many countries by the way i believe trade i believe in trade deals one country at a time boom boom boom you got to see the lines well have one line and if they dont do wellif they dont behave themselves if they want to start devaluing their currency all over the place very simple we write them a notice like we do in business we serve them with a 30 day notice and by the way you just saw how great are our police right law and order we need law and order we need law and order and we will have law and order our police our firemen  but our police do a fantastic job they are not recognized for the great job they do if they have 500000 incidents all positively beautifully handled one bad thing happens that one bad thing is on the news for two weeks and it a disgrace it a disgraceso we should be very thankful for the job they do so pennsylvania is losing a lot of its business right now were sitting here were talking  oh here another one go home to mom go home to mom and your mother is voting for trump! she voting for trump it true it trueby the way just to interject  so i was told this whole area is democratic meaning democrat and i was told that by a lot of different people outside and then they said i cant believe that you have 10000 people you have people outside trying to get inthey said the came up to me this is  happens to be a democrat who i happen to know is a good guycame up to me and said ive never seen anything like it it always goes democrat is that a correct statement said you are going to win erie in a and the surrounding area  youre going to win in a landslide gonna be a landslide because people are tired of lies theyre tired of losing their jobs theyre tired of seeing their companies being ripped out and going to other places theyre tired of china coming in and dropping steel all over the place to put your companies out of business so we have to go to china to get our steel which is happening very quicklyand that why the steel workers are with me that why the miners are with me that why the working people electricians the plumbers the sheetrockers the concrete guys and gals theyre all  theyre with usand i grew up you know they say you know youre really rich how come you sort of relate to these people well my father built houses and i used to work in these houses and i got to know the electricians i got to know all these people i got to know the plumbers the steamfittersi got to know them alland i liked them better than the rich people that i know i know a lot of rich people it true theyre better i like them betterso anywayand we are going to put people back to work were not playing games and it going to go quickly by the way it going to go quicklybut look at this ok so erie has lost one in three manufacturing jobs you know that all iyou doi flew over youre looking at the plants plants that 25 years ago 20 years ago 15 years ago some two years ago were vibrantbut no plant two years ago was too vibrant because it was down to half down to a quarter down to a tenth and then ultimately they closed but you see them they are falling over the rain the sleet the snow the wind these are great buildings that are falling apart dont feel bad all over the country upstate new york is a disaster which hillary clinton said that she was going to fixok so the washington post is extraordinarily dishonest and that fine but they wrote a story i couldnt believe i saw this story they talked about hillary clinton it was a headline hillary clinton and when she ran for the united states senator from new york she said to the people in upstate new york which was starting to really have problems because of her husband bill naftaand companies were leaving tremendous unemployment tremendous problems making nothing and she said i will turn it around i will create 200000 jobs were going to do a great job guess what she got elected she did nothing and the only ones that benefited were the consultants and the people that helped her out it is a disaster upstate new york is right now worse than anything you have in the state of pennsylvania she did nothingand i watched her yesterday which was hard to do because she is boring ok i watched her yesterday talking aboutyou know what funny i said im going to renegotiate nafta and they said what happens if you cant make a deal i said were going to terminate were getting out and so ive been saying that and ive been saying were going to renegotiate different trade deals and were going to make great trade deals and all this and she never said that all of a sudden two days ago i will renegotiate trade deals she not going to do it folks she going to renegotiate trade deals the same way she was going to put 200000 jobs in upstate new yorkit turned out to be a total fantasy and i have to tell you i respect the washington post for writing one bad story because you what theyre doing and reince was alluding to it a little bit the only way she gets elected is if they dont report on her they dont show her they have me on so much television there cnn you talk about dishonesty it called the clintonwaitit called the clinton news network cnn now think of it clinton isshe hardly ever on so yesterday they have yesterday a scandal with the emails another one im not talking about the 33000 emails that she deleted or got rid of can you imagine what was on those emails can you imagine i love that can you imagine what was on those emails 33000 emails were deleted and she said well it had to do with the wedding and yogai give two to yoga i give five to the wedding ill tell you the lies the deception were running like they run right now a third world country folks ok you saw what happened it running like a third world country were being talked about all over the world nobody can believe itin fact when they were going over the charges against hillary clinton one after another after another after another however and yet other people their lives have been destroyed for doing much less all righttheir lives have been destroyed so now they have a big scandal in new york it in the new york papers but very little pay right pay for play and it horrifying it horrifying our government is for sale our government is for sale by a crooked person and what theyre doing is theyre trying to not talk about her take a look you go to cnn as an example story after story about trump storytrump trump trump trumpand yesterday it was announced that people are tired of negativethe hit jobs and cnn starting to do very poorly that good i like that i like that and i have to say fox has been treating us fairly fox has been fair but cnn has been catastrophic it so dishonestbut somebody was explaining to me their theory if they dont report on her people arent going to know how bad she is look at her news conference she hasnt had a news conference in like 260 days that last one wasnt a news conference that was a few of her friends they asked her a question what did she say about the circuit right let me tell you if i ever said that short circuited if i ever said i shortcircuited it would be headlines all over the world they would call for the death penalty can you imagine if i said that i shortcircuited i mean i stand up here for months in front of massive crowds she gets 300 people going to her events she gets 300 people and then she reads something from a teleprompter and then she leaves and she goes home and she goes to sleep and then she wakes and she goes again and im telling youand nobody does anything about it now me i stand up hereim not looking at notes im not reading teleprompters not easy not easy not easy butbutrememberbutand if i make one mistake  say he mention something wrong he got a wrong date it like headlines all over she can say she shortcircuited up here i dont want a president who shortcircuits is that ok i dont want it i dont want a president who shortcircuits weve got to deal with isis weve got to deal with china weve got to deal with lots of people theyre not shortcircuiting but i dont want somebody that shortcircuits so let me just tell youlet me just tell youover the last little whileyou know every time it always a big deal when i said that obamaand of course im being sarcastic and they know that because after i said that i said he the mvp he going to collect his mvp award okso i said obama is the founder of isis the founder and these dishonest media peopletheyre the most dishonest people they said oh did he mean that didnt he mean that and after that id say a lotin fact they like him so much because he been so weak and so bad i mean he let this happen they had eight states they had eight countries theyre now in 28 countries theyre expandingso i said the founder ofobviously im being sarcastic thenthenbut not that sarcastic to be honest with you and they all said he should not say that they should call him an enabler call him an enabler he an enabler i said that doesnt sound the same he an enabler people are going to say whatthese people are the worst but listen so i said the founder of isis and in fact very soon he going over to pick up his most valuable player award did i say that i say it all the time  so they knew i was being sarcastic by now theyre analyzing did i really mean that how could i say that these people are the lowest form of life im telling you the lowest they are the lowest form of humanity not all of them they have about 25 percent that are pretty good actually but most of themok so here the story so erie has lost a lot right you know that right hang in dont leave i promise we can fix it so fast we will stop these countries from taking our jobs we will stop these countries from taking our companies hold onour jobs will come back now i came up with a great plan im lowering corporate taxes so our companies stay so i dont even have to make the call the corporate inversions  you know we have companies that have they say two and a half trillion dollars outside of our comp  they cant get their money back we dont let themeverybody agrees that we should do it republicans democrats everybody agreeswhat the  look why do we not want them to bring money back you know why because we dont have a president that can sit the leaders of both parties around a table and in about five minutes let them say let bring this money back in so we can work it in this country rightthat what it is so were going to bring that money back in were going to lower taxes were going to keep our companies  and if our companies want to leave theyre going to pay a nice big beautiful tax to get their product back inok that what going to happen so the existing us trade deficit with tpp participating nations has already cost pennsylvania 68000 jobs folks no more folkswere not going to be stupid people any more were going to be the really really smart people it going to be america first america first america first first so the destruction of manufacturing in pennsylvania was caused by hillary clinton and her husband disastrous trade policiesi mean you take a look at what she done at the bidding of her corporate funders hillary clinton has backed every jobkilling trade deal for decades she has received so much money she has approved virtually every tax increase put before heryesterday  you see 13 trillion in tax increases were the highest taxed nation in the land essentially were the highest taxed nation in the world anywhere in the worldand of the industrialized nations were far and away the highest taxed nation and she proposing a massive tax increase folks we cant do it it going to make our country noncompetitive  it already noncompetitiveit going to make our country noncompetitive and were not going to do it im proposing a massive tax decrease for the middle class for business and businesses are going to pour in  not since ronald reagan has anything like this been proposedbusinesses instead of leaving because their taxes are so high theyre going to stay i might not even have to make those calls now if i do i will meaning my people will ill do some i love doing it i would love telling some guy youre not moving well mr president sir we would like to move to mexico youre not moving and if you do you pay the 35 percent tax you say well in that case im not moving im not moving in that case im not moving so easyso your coal industry your steel industry which has been ravaged your general electrics of the world which have been ravaged just ravaged were going to end it and ill tell you why over the years ive watched for years for 10 years for 12 years for 15 years beyond obama and ive watched as politicians talked about stopping countries from leaving  companies from leaving our states you need strength is rightour states and i watched remember they give the lowinterest loans here a lowinterest loan if you stay in pennsylvania here a zerointerest loan you dont have to pay here a this here tax abatement of any kind you want well help your  it doesnt work folks that not what they need they have moneythey want to go out they want to move to another country and because our politicians are so dumb they want to sell their product to us and not have any retribution not have any consequencesso all of that over and i think you understand it and hillary cant do it number one she cant do it because the mentality isnt there she cant do it no the mentalityyou know she said fairly recently i dont like donald trump tone his tone isnt nice and i said here we have a country that being taken advantage of by every country in the world our businesses are being taken our jobs being taken everything being takenhere we have a world where isis is chopping off the heads of christians and many others drowning people in steel cages burying people in the sand and we have somebody up there who wants to be our president that says i

of our citizensamerican values and culture will be cherished and celebrated once againbut to achieve this future we must break free from the bitter failures of the past  and reject the same insiders telling us the same old liesone area where honesty is badly needed is on the subject of economic and living conditions for africanamerican citizens in the united statesmillions of africanamericans in this country have succeeded greatly and their contributions to every area of our life  now and throughout our history  should be celebrated and cherished this includes the amazing achievements in art science sport music medicine business and so much else this includes millions of africanamerican entrepreneurs innovators and the millions of africanamerican workers in our middle classbut we must also talk about those who have been left behind the millions suffering in disastrous conditions in so many of our inner cities  and neighborhoods afflicted by poverty drugs and violenceno group in america has been more harmed by hillary clinton policies than africanamericansthere is no better evidence of this fact than hillary clinton immigration policy which brings in illegal immigrants and refugees to take jobs from hardworking africanamerican and hispanic citizensinstead of providing free healthcare and jobs to millions of refugees from around the world we should rebuild our inner cities and provide jobs to struggling americanstonight i am asking for the vote of every africanamerican and hispanic citizen in this country who wants a better futurethe inner cities of our country have been run by the democratic party for fifty sixty seventy yearsthese democratic policies  the policies of hillary clinton  have produced only poverty joblessness failing schools broken homes and rising crimenearly 4 in 10 africanamerican children live in poverty including 45 of children under the age of six 58 of africanamerican youth are not working meanwhile another 2 million hispanicamericans have been added to the ranks of those in poverty since 2009in detroit half of all its residents do not work in milwaukee almost 4 in 10 africanamerican men between the ages of 2454

results to those suffering i say what do you have to lose by voting for donald trump i will fix it i will fight for you as no one ever has beforelet me also tell you what you have to gain jobs opportunity security and safetythis means so much to mei believe every child in this country  in detroit in baltimore in chicago  has the right to live out their lives in safety and peacein the wall street journal heather mac donald of the manhattan institute just wrote an important article about the soaring crime in our inner cities and the responsibility of democratic politicians for creating this problemthe article is called black lives matter to donald trump mcdonald writes that mr trump call to restore law and order recognizes the right of innercity residents to enjoy the same freedom from fear that the rest of america now takes for grantedfreedom from violence is one of the great civil rights issues of our time so too is the issue of school choicewe will fight for the right of parents to send their kids to the school that they believe gives their kids the best shot at successi will not accept a future in which children of any color in this country are not fully included in the american dream our whole country loses when we leave millions of talented aspiring americans on the sidelines we want to give everyone a chance to contribute their full talents to our economy and our countryremember the republican party is the party of lincoln the party of freedom equality and opportunity it is the democratic party that is the party of slavery the party of jim crow the party

iraq in the first place which i opposedher tenure as secretary of state may be regarded as the most disastrous in us historylook at the world before and after she became secretary of stateprehillary in early 2009 iraq was seeing a reduction in violencelibya was stablesyria was under controlthe group we know today as isis was close to being extinguishediran was being choked by sanctionsnow

for speeches during her tenure an increase of 44 over the previous 4 yearsthen there was all the money funneled into the clinton foundation from foreign governments and corporationsit was payforplay just look at what she did with ubs or the russian uranium or disaster relief in haiti and so many other examplesbut the only way to learn the full depth of her public corruption is to read the 33000 emails she deletedhillary clinton said under oath that she turned over all of her workrelated emails but we know that is one more clinton lie the fbi found thousands of workrelated emails she never turned over and then another 15000 emails were just discovered a few weeks agonow today another 30 emails were discovered by the state department that hillary clinton failed to turn over  these were emails about benghaziit just never ends with the clintonsthere is only one way to get justice in this rigged system and that is to show up and vote on november 8th  and to vote bigin a trump

29,thank you thank you very much thank you ladies and gentlemen thank you please sit down thank youit my privilege to be here in gettysburg hallowed ground where so many lives were given in service to freedom amazing placepresident lincoln served at a time of division like weve never seen before it is my hope that we can look at his example to heal the divisions we are living through right now we are a very divided nationim not a politician and have never wanted to be a politician believe me but when i saw the trouble our country was in i knew i couldnt stand by and watch any longerour country has been so good to me i love our country and i felt i had to act ive seen the system upcloseandpersonal for many years ive been a major part of iti know how the game works in washington and on wall street and i know how theyve rigged the rules of the game against everyday americans the rules are riggednearly one in four americans in their prime earning years isnt even working one in five households have no one with a job 45 million americans are on food stamps and 47 million are living in povertywe have failed our inner cities and in so doing have failed our africanamerican and hispanic communitiesweve misguided military adventures overseas and wars that go on forever that just cannot be won by the people that are doing it now they dont know how to win the wars at homewe have our great veterans dying while waiting for medical carechange has to come from outside our very broken system our system is brokenthe fact that washington and the washington establishment has tried so hard to stop our campaign is only more proof that our campaign represents the kind of change that only arrives onceinalifetime the system is totally rigged and broken first the issue of voter fraud according to pew there are 24 million voter registrations in the united states that are either invalid or significantly significantly inaccurate and when i say that there are such inaccuracies it unbelievable18 million dead people are registered to vote and some of them are voting i wonder how that happens28 million people are registered in more than one state is a number folks these are numbersfourteen percent of noncitizens are registered to vote the system is also rigged because hillary clinton should have been precluded from running for the presidency of the united states but the fbi and the justice department covered up her crimes which included lying to the fbi and congress on numerous occasions and included saying i do not recall to the fbi on 39 separate timesshe recalls everything else but 39 separate times she said i do not recall well that a lies also then there is the deletion of at least 33000 emails after receiving a subpoena from the united states congress that after receiving the subpoena as an exampleit was announced this week that the highlyrespected fourstar general james cartwright maybe sentenced to up to five years in prison with a massive fine for lying on one occasion to the fbi he said he did that for national security reasonshighly respected man a fourstar general this took place two days ago how must he feel a big part of the rigging of this election is the fact that hillary is being allowed to run despite having broken so many laws on so many different occasionswhy is she allowed to run the dishonest mainstream media is also part in a major part of this corruption theyre corrupt they lie and fabricate stories to make a candidate that is not their preferred choice look as bad and even dangerous as possibleat my rallies they never show or talk about the massive crowd size and try to diminish all of our eventson the other hand they dont show the small size of hillary crowds but in fact talk about how many people are there very small crowds you know it they know itover the last two days three highly respected national polls said were in first place and one of those pollsters was the most accurate pole on the last two cycles but the media refuses to even say it or put that word out they refused to talk about ittheyre trying desperately to suppress my vote and the voice of the american people as an example of the power structure and fighting at&t is buying time warner and the cnn a deal we will not approve in my administration because it too much concentration of power in the hands of too fewlikewise amazon which through its ownership controls the washington post should be paying massive taxes it not paying and it a very unfair playing field and you see what that happening and what that doing to department stores all over the countryvery very unfair and youre talking about billions and billions of dollars they should be paying those taxesadditionally comcast purchase of nbc concentrates far too much power in one massive entity that is trying to tell the voters what to think and what to do deals like this destroy democracy and well look at breaking that deal up and other deals like thatthis should never ever have been approved in the first place theyre trying to poison the mind of the american voter every woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign total fabrication the events never happened never all of these liars will be sued after the election is over but a simple phone called placed to the biggest newspapers or television networks get them walltowall coverage with virtually no factchecking whatsoeverhere is why this is relevant to you if they can fight somebody like me who has unlimited resources to fight back just look at what they can do to you your jobs your security your education your healthcare the violation of religious liberty the theft of your second amendment the loss of your factories your homes and much morelook at what theyve done to you with your jobs it is just been lined on video that the violent protests at some of my rallies like in chicago where police and others were seriously hurt you saw that blood pouring down their face were caused by paid paid dnc and clinton campaign operativesnow we didnt know this we didnt know this just came out two days ago on tape we didnt know this we were amazed at the level of violence these were paid operatives paid by the dnc and probably the clinton campaignthis is a criminal act policemen were badly hurt and so were many others and these people prosecuted but because of the rigged system they probably wont be just like we found out about these paid violent protesters it was probably the dnc and the clinton campaign that put forward these liars with their fabricated stories but well find out their involvement at a later date through litigation and i look so forward to doingthe rigging of the system is designed for one reason to keep the corrupt establishment and special interests in power at your expense and everybody expensei have no special interest but you the american vogel i didnt have to do this believe me there nothing easy about it but i had to do iti love our countryi love the people of our country and i felt i had to do it thank you one thing we all know is that we will never solve our problems by relying on the same politicians who created these problems in the first placehillary clinton is not running against me she running against change and she running against all of the american people and all of the american voters we now find ourselves at that very special fork in the road do we repeat the mistakes of the past or do we choose to believe that a great future yet unwritten still lies ahead for us and for our wonderful beloved country i think it

highway where they get the jobs they get the factories they get the money and we get the drugs and we get the unemployment and it going to changebelieve me it going to change and that goes for all countries when you look at china when you look at every trade deal we have is horrible and we should be ashamed of a people and the people that let those deals happentheyre defective and they knew

donald j trump and the american voter  and begins with bringing honesty accountability and change to washington dctherefore on the first day of my term of office my administration will immediately

that what happening on the same day i will begin taking and really taking strongly 7 actions to protect american workers our american workers have been treated so badly by politicians that dont have their interest at heart and we are going to change that were going to change that very very fastfirst i will announce my intention to totally renegotiate nafta one of the worst deals our country has ever made signed by bill clinton or withdraw from the deal under article 2205 second i will announce our withdrawal from the transpacific partnership a potential disaster for our country third i will direct my secretary of the treasury to label china a currency manipulator china is a currency manipulator what they have done to us by playing currency is very sad and i dont blame them they have been very smart i blame our politicians for letting this take place so easy to stop so easy to standfourth i will direct the secretary of commerce and us trade representative to identify all foreign trading abuses that unfairly impact american workers and direct them to use every tool under american and international law to end those abuses immediately fifth very importantly i will lift the restrictions on the production of 50 trillion dollars worth of job producing american energy reserves  including shale oil natural gas and clean coal and we will put our miners back to worksixth i will lift the obamaclinton roadblocks that allow for this vital energy infrastructure projects to forward we have roadblocks like youve never ever seen environmental blocks structural blocks were going to allow the keystone pipeline and so many other things to move forward tremendous numbers of jobs and good for our countryseventh we are going to cancel billions in payments to un climate change programs  and use the money to fix america water and environmental infrastructure were paying billions and billions and billions of dollars were going to fix our own environment additionally on the first day i will take the following five actions to restore security and the constitutional rule of law we have to do thatfirst cancel every unconstitutional executive action memorandum and order issued by president obamasecond begin the process of selecting a replacement for justice scalia whose wife by the way has a trump sign his wife is a phenomenal woman has a trump sign in her front yard isnt that nice i just found that out this morning from one of the 20 judges on my list you know were going to make great decisions from twenty outstanding judges on a list that we submitted who will uphold and defend the constitution of the united states third we will cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities fourth we will begin removing the more than 2 million criminal illegal immigrants from the country these are drug dealers gang heads gang members killers and cancel visas to foreign countries that wont take them back  and when hillary clinton was secretary of state and they had someone who was bad really bad and they brought him back to the country and the country wouldnt take him she said well bring him back we dont want to force the country to take him there wont be one such instance if i become president fifth were going to suspend immigration from terrorprone regions where vetting cannot safely occur  and if you look at syria and the migration were taking in thousands and thousands of people into our country we have no idea who they are what their thought process is where they come from and hillary clinton wants to increase the number of those thousands and thousands currently pouring by 550 radical islamic terror is right around the corner we have to be so tough so smart so vigilant we cant allow that to happen  we have enough problems  all vetting of people coming into our country will be considered extreme vetting we will be very carefulnext i will work with congress to introduce the following broader legislative measures and fight for their passage within the first 100 days of my administration1 middle class tax relief and simplification act an economic plan designed to grow the economy 4 per year and create at least 25 million new jobs through massive tax reduction and simplification in combination with trade reform regulatory relief and lifting the restrictions on american energy  we need that so badly we need jobs our jobs have left us our good jobs have really left usthe largest tax reductions are for the middle class  who have been forgotten called the forgotten man and woman they have been forgotten a middleclass family with 2 children will get basically a 35 tax cut and that what they can use and that money will go back into the economy the current number of brackets will be reduced from 7 to 3 and tax forms will likewise be greatly simplified the business rate will be lowered from 35 to 15 percent and the trillions of dollars of american corporate money overseas can now be brought back at a 10 percent rate it stuck we cant bring it back two and a half to five trillion dollars companies cant get it back into the country some companies are actually leaving not only because taxes are so high but because the cant get their money and they are actually leaving to get their money we are going to simplify that were going to have them bring the money back into our country and use the money and spend the money on building our country 2 the offshoring act establishes tariffs to discourage companies from laying off their workers in order to relocate in other countries and ship their products back to the us taxfree they leave the united stated like carrier like forward like so many others they leave the united states and fire all of their employees they go to mexico or another country they build a beautiful brand new plant they hire other people they then take their air conditioners their cars whatever theyre making they send it tax free across what will be a very strong border believe me  but they send it tax free across the border and what do we end with we havewe have unemployment tremendous losses and we have none of the benefits so we will establish tariffs that when they do that there will be consequences we will work with them we will be nice we will be fair but there has to be consequences and when they know their consequences our companies will stop leaving the united states and going to other countries3 american energy & infrastructure act leverages publicprivate partnerships and private investments through tax incentives to spur 1 trillion in infrastructure investment over 10 years our infrastructure is in such trouble weve doubled our national debt to 20 trillion dollars under president obama in less than 8 years 10 trillion dollars has been added think of it and we havent fixed anything we havent fixed anything what have we doe our roads are broken our bridges our tunnels our hospitals our schools and we have 20 trillion in debt alltime high that true our va hospitals are in bad shape va is in very very bad shape and we will fix that we are going to work on fixing that  because our veterans are not treated properly we have illegal immigrants that are treated far better in many instances than our veterans  and were not going to have that it is revenue neutral4 school choice and education opportunity act redirects education dollars to gives parents the right to send their kid to the public private charter magnet religious or home school of their choice  and so importantly ends common core brings education supervision to local communitieswe do so badly on education if you look at the lists you see sweden norway denmark different countries at the top you see us at the bottom and yet by far perpupil more money than anybody and it not even close we spend more money perpupil than anybody not even close were at the bottom of the list other countries spending far less perpupil are at the top of the list so obviously our current system is not working we will change it and we will make it good  it expands vocational and technical education which weve totally forgotten about in this country and make 2 and 4year college more affordablehave you ever gone to school and youve been with people that arent good students but they can fix an engine or they can build a wall or they can do things that you wouldnt even think about because we can use some of the one who build the wall  were going to need them  were going to need them but did you ever see that how they are genius at fixing a car they can do anything but history not so good physics not so good we have to open vocational again those are people those are great people5 repeal and replace obamacare act  fully repeal obamacare and replace it with health savings accounts so we can do that the health savings account it one way there are numerous ways but this one very good way the ability to purchase health insurance across state lines we have to do it because that competition the politicians wont let go of it because the insurance companies they dont want competition but well open it up believe me we will get rid of it ive been saying it for years and lets states manage medicaid funds it will be so good reforms will also include cutting the red tape at the fda there are over 4000 drugs awaiting approval and we especially want to speed the approval of lifesaving medications mean they are looking at drugs that are looking very good and you have terminal patients that it over these people are dying they want to get the drug they wont be living much longer and we study it for years and years and at some point they have to do what they have to do they have to do it properly but we have 4000 different drugs and products waiting in ling for approval and we cant get them approved we are going to speed up that process very significantly6 affordable childcare and eldercare act allows americans to deduct childcare and elder care from their taxes incentivizes employers to provide onsite childcare services and you see that with a couple of companies and it is such a great thing to see and creates taxfree dependent care savings accounts for both young and elderly dependents with matching contributions for lowincome families  so good7 end illegal immigration act fullyfunds the construction of a wall on our southern border dont worry about it remember i said mexico paying for the wall with the full understanding that the country mexico will be reimbursing the united states for the full cost of such wall ok we are going to have the wall mexico is going to pay for the wall mexico by the way i met with the president of mexico 2 months ago wonderful meeting wonderful person but i told him this is a twoway highway not a oneway highwaywe have our people we have out take care of our people have to protect our people so it got to be a twoway street otherwise it is going to be a whole different deal but establishes a 2year mandatory minimum federal prison sentence there are people coming in illegally for illegally reentering the us after a previous deportation and a 5year mandatory minimum for illegally reentering for those with felony convictions multiple misdemeanor convictions or two or more prior deportations so when somebody comes in we send them out they come back they go to prison for quite a while they come back they come back again they go five years because what is happening is they are coming back ten times and i could go cases after case they come backlook at what happened in san francisco five times he came back on the fifth time he killed five times but so many others 110 times came back killed somebody after ten times when they get deported they stay out otherwise they have very serious prison terms they will stay out once you do that they will stay out right now they have no consequence they have no consequencealso reforms on visa rules to enhance penalties for overstaying and to ensure open jobs are offered to american workers first 8 restoring community safety act reduces surging crime drugs and violence by creating a task force on violent crime and increasing funding for programs that train and assist local police who are doing such a great job believe me we increase the resources for federal law enforcement agencies and federal prosecutors to dismantle criminal gangs and put violent offenders behind bars  or out of our country and into the country where they came from 9 restoring national security act which rebuilds our military by eliminating the defense sequester which has been very tough on military and expanding military investmentnow at no time practically do we need a military like right now we dont want to use it but it is peace through strength we need a strong military our military is so terribly depleted it also provides veterans with the ability to receive public va treatment or attend the private doctor of their choice if theyre waiting on line and i have the plan up and weve gotten as you know tremendous support from veterans from law enforcement from veterans from the military tremendous support but if theyre waiting in line and you see it 22 suicides a day people dont even believe it but 22 suicides a day but if theyre waiting in line 47 days 6 days 9 days they cant get to see a doctor and a simple procedure or a simple prescription can solve their problem and they become very sick and they die they die waiting in line were going to give them the power to go across the street to a local doctor a private doctor a public hospital or private hospital all looking to help and all looking to do business and we will pay the bill so much cheaper but much more importantly the veterans will finally be taken care of properly because what they are going through now is unacceptable also we are going to protect our vital infrastructure from the new thing cyberattack establishes new screening procedures for immigration to ensure those who are admitted to our country support our people and our values  we want people that love our country or can love our country and people that will love our citizens we want people that can love us and there are ways through talent of determining that and other countries do but we dont just come on in folks just come on in10 clean up corruption in washington act enacts tough new ethics reforms to reduce the corrupting influence of special interests and donors on our politicson november 8th americans will be voting for this 100day plan to restore prosperity to our economy security to our communities and honesty to our government this is my pledge to you and if we follow these steps we will once more have a government of by and for the people and importantly we will make america great againbelieve me

31,so how good is he how good is he special special he is a special man and special person and he has become my friend oh there is a lot of people here whoa hello everybody your football team is going to have a great year i watch i watch youve got the quarterback youve got the whole deal i think it going to be a very good year ok and if you get into that super bowl i will be going all rightso you know i wrote something down before and i think it is important because  i love you too because we need unity we have to win this election this is truly one of the most important elections certainly in my lifetime because we are about to go  we lose it we are in the wrong direction and maybe it gone supreme court justices always remember that but so many different levels and when you see what happened with crooked hillary today it was a disaster a disaster she had a disaster she lies folks she lies badly so i want to  i just wrote this out i wanted to say to the group you know i had a great time when i was in wisconsin and i did not quite eke it out i thought i was going to but after that it worked out well you built me up you taught me about politicsand when i left here i said i think ive learned a lot so i love it i love the people i have many friends in wisconsin and theyre  theyre incredible people youre incredible people i have to tell you that and were going to have a lot of fun we are going to have a lot of fun but i had to write this this campaign is not about me or any one candidate it is about america it is time for a change we need a change a real change not an obama change we dont need an obama change we have had enough it is time to change a rigged political system that works only for the insiders and replace it with a government that serves the people have to do it and know both sides ive been on the other side believe me i actually like this side better this is a movement this is a movement like they may be have never seen in this country according to even the political pundits that truly hate me ok this is a  they  oh this is a movement that some say most say is one of the great phenomenon that theyve ever seen in politicssome say it the single greatest phenomenon though the media doesnt want to talk about it we have done something  we all of us together im a messenger im only a messenger we have done something truly historic together standing before you as nominee for president and im not a politician proudly im not part of the system i ran against the system and im probably better off running against the system i ran against the donors im my own donor essentially i have a lot of money under this deal this is a very expensive crisis i want to tell you i funded  as you know i funded the primaries and im in for under 60 million and im largely funding my campaign as we go forward in addition to that  in addition to that we have raised tremendous amounts of money and much of it from small donors61 61 as a republican that doesnt happen it happens because of what you are seeing in front of you todayand if you remember just prior to june they did a story donald trump has not really done too well with fund raising well that is because i did not even know if i was getting the nomination im not going to raise funds  i wouldve had enough if i didnt make it i would have said bye bye politicsbut i wanted to make sure  so i got it and then i started raising money for the republican party and we raised a lot of money we started really on june 14th flag day my birthday my birthday and in june we raised approximately  think of this  51 million can you imagine and those people couldnt believe it they were really surprised big headlines you know because they dont give me too many good headlines i could do the greatest things i do things that i think a fantastici say good there is no way they cover this badly and they cover it badly i gently tell a woman that i love her baby and let the baby cry it is ok as the baby that had a voice that was superior to pavarotti continued to cry  i remember i told her to stay dont worry maambut after about 3 or 4 minutes and im trying to speak and it was in jacksonville we had this massive massive crowd filled up the stadium and the baby screaming so i said maam i would like to reverse my order perhaps you could nicely take  take the baby out your baby is greati did it so nicely she was happy even the baby was happy he stopped crying and maybe you could take the baby out would that be possible the whole place was cracking up and the next day in the newspaper it said trump throws baby out of arenaterrible now they are very dishonest that was a tough one when i  and i just had a reporter come up to me backstage a reporter come up  mr trump sir but why did you throw that baby out of the area i said i was having fun i was so nice i was so nice everybody likes me the baby liked me the mother liked me we had a good time i try to keep the baby in but the baby was such  had such a powerful voice in fact i want to find out who that baby is because i want to sponsor the baby and that baby will sing someday in philharmonic hall im telling you new york city ok the great philharmonic so im not part of the system i ran against the system i ran against the donors because im largely my own donor im running against myself that sort of  never thought of it that way and against the status quo and the status quo we have to get rid of because it is not working folks because the country is a mess and that is why put up a lot of money but while the democrats nominated the candidate of special interests and really a candidate of total corruption i mean you take a look at what she is doing the republicans made history by choosing a nominee from outside of this very very corrupt the system it is a corrupt systemit a corrupt system you want something done they can do it for you and that is not necessarily and usually it isnt good for the countrythat is why were going to be able to deliver real change and real safety and real opportunity to all americans we have to unite remember thateverything ive accomplished i have done by putting together a really fantastic team including governor mike pence of indiana who has done an incredible done an incredible job my wonderful staff of people that really love what we are doing and they are working so hard my family friends and it expanding all the timebut i need a republican senate and a house to accomplish all of the changes that we have to make we have to make them right i understand and embrace the wisdom of ronald reagan big tent within the party big big tent remember ronald reagan great man great guy remember he included reagan democrats and independents and republicans a lot of people were going to have the same thing there a lot of democrats perhaps in this room are there a lot of democrats raise your hands i mean i dont think we need too many to be honest with you but  so i embraced the wisdom that my 80 percent friend is not my 20 percent enemy ronald reagan stated by ronald reagan pretty goodwe will be the big tent party we are going to have a lot of cross help we are going to have a lot of bernie sanders people coming in because of trade because bernie sanders knew we were being ripped off by trade trade is a disaster with china with japan with mexico with vietnam with so many countries with every country every countrywe dont win at any level with anything and as a unified party we will lead our country to unity as well very important we need the unity we have to win the election no we have to win it  have to win it otherwise our big movement was not as big as we thought and that not good that why november 8th youve got to get everybody you know  and you know all this voter id nowadays a lot of places arent going to have voter id now what does that mean what does that mean you just keep walking in and voting so you have to be very careful very vigilant  you have to be carefulbut we will have disagreements but we will disagree as friends and never stop working together toward victory and very importantly toward real change so in our shared mission to make america great again i support and endorse our speaker of the house paul ryan paul ryan he good he a good man he a good man and he a good guy and we may disagree on a couple of things but mostly we agree and were going get it done and were going to do a lot of wonderful things he a good man and while im at it i hold in the highest esteem senator john mccain for his service to our country in uniform and in public office and i fully support and endorse his reelection very important well work together i also fully support and endorse senator kelly ayotte of new hampshire a state i truly love primarily because that was my first victory but i love new hampshire no i love new hampshire one of the most beautiful places she a rising star and will continue to represent the great people of new hampshire so very well for a long long time senator kelly ayotte working handinhand we will grow our majority in the house and in the senate we need that weve got to get things done arm in arm we will rescue the nation from the obamaclinton disaster which is exactly what it is that has bled our country dry and spread terrorism unabated across the world that what happening you saw it just now maps came out yesterday they said isis far bigger it all over the place it all over the place were going to get rid of it folks our military is depleted were going to build up our military we are going to get others with us believe me were going to get plenty of others with us and speaking of others wouldnt it actually be wonderful if we could get along with russia wouldnt that be nice they talk so big and so brave and so tough theyre the tough ones you know hillary real tough give me a break wouldnt that be great we get along with russia we go out together with others and we knock the hell out of isis wouldnt that be great together we will lead our country back to prosperity security and peace ok when you look at the world and what happened  so we have the queen of corruption she the queen of corruption she is a disaster i said before if crooked hillary clinton becomes president terrorism will destroy the inner workings of our country believe me they are loving itshe wants to have 550 percent more people coming in from syria and that region into our nation and we dont know who they are we dont know where they come from really we dont know if theyre isis some will be and look at the damage that done in san bernardino with a couple  probably he became radicalized by her  a couple and these were friends of theirs these were people that gave a party in celebration of the birth of their child and they were gunned down 14 people killed many many injuredtake a look at orlando  take a look at orlando how disgusting that was take a look at the world trade center and so many other places go to the probably toughest gun laws anywhere in the world go to paris and take a look at that 130 people gunned down you know if people had guns on the other side where the bullets are flying in the other direction like you sir you sir you and you maam first of all if they knew guns were in the room they probably wouldnt have gone there there were no guns they were just sitting ducks 130 people in san bernardino you had 14 peoplebut in paris just like this boom  get over here boom  get over here boom  130 people with many still in the hospital many so gravely wounded it horrible and if they had bullets flying in the other direction maybe they wouldnt have shown up and if they did ill tell you what you wouldnt have had that kind of carnage you would have had people lying on the other side of the floor instead so hillary clinton wants to do major damage as you know to our second amendment hillary clinton wants to put judges  she wants to put justices of the supreme court  she going to make them nice and liberal wait until  wait until you see what that does to your rights wait until you see what that does to your second amendment you will not recognize it you will not recognize it national rifle association nra endorsed me theyre great people wayne  theyre great people chris they love this country they endorsed me very early and it really a  it really an honor ill tell you what they are phenomenal people when you get to know them they love the country  you know they love the country they take a lot of heat but they love the country ill tell you that right nowand i heard mike governor pence talking about 12 growth  12 percent growth the lowest in memory since the 1940 when you think about it it the lowest so a lot of differences between all of us but i thought i would mention  because ive known hillary clinton over the years  i know her  and she makes statements she makes statements and they are statements coming out of her playbookwell let see we cant get them for this  cant get them for this ive always heard that i have the best temperament people tell me i have the best temperament i have a temperament to win we got to win we got to winshe said not so long ago i dont like donald trump tone now she is reading it off teleprompters only i dont like donald trump tone and i said you know we need a tough tone today we have people  we need a kind tone but we need a tough tonewe have people being beheaded all over the middle east and other places we have crime that is rampant we have people in the middle east being drowned in steel cages this is like medieval times and she is worried about my toneso they chop off heads and they drown people and they bury people in sand and then they ask me mr trump sir  at one of the debates in which i won im very happy about that  mr trump sir how do you feel about waterboarding im seeing chopped off heads drowned people burying in sand  i said im absolutely ok with it let me tell you can you imagine what the enemy must say  can you imagine the enemy  isis in this case  can you imagine what they must say as they spent the day chopping off the heads of christians  come back get together and start talking  and they say waterboarding is not allowed in the united states  by the united states waterboarding is not allowedfolks we better get smart and tough and we are playing games with hillary we are playing games it is just games she is not the right person and everybody knows it her single greatest achievement is being caught in a crime and getting away with it this is true 33000 emails so i wrote this before on the way over to another rally at also a very nice place that very full and very nice in iowa and we love iowa dont we yes right i thought it was accurate unstable  and she is she is unstable hillary clinton lacks the judgment that bernie sanders had you just have to pay attention as soon as he said it i started writing notes she has bad judgment she lacks the judgment temperament and moral character to lead this country plus she is a weak person we dont need a weak person he just said plus she is a criminalshe is a dangerous liar who has disregarded the lives of americans and who has put all of us at great risk while supporting economic policies that have destroyed our economy we have a long way to goshe is unhinged she truly unhinged and she is unbalanced totally unbalanced and you can see in the words of a secret service agent who just wrote a book i bought the book i wanted to see what he had to say she simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the officefrom my bottom of my soul he said i know this to be true he was there her leadership style volcanic impulsive as it is disdainful of the rules set for everyone else hasnt changed a bit she unqualified to become president and she really is and bernie said that too thank you what great people wowno but it is true no games it is true in one way she is a monster ok look at what happened look at her history in another way she is a weak person she is actually not strong enough to be president so she got both but she is not strong enough to be presidentshe will be a be a disaster she will be so bad for our country and im not just talking about justices of the supreme court she will be so bad for our country and we cant let it happen we cant let it happenyou know mike pence told me a story and maybe i should not say it but i found it interesting but of the reasons  i guess the primary reason that he in politics is because he watched the crookedness of the clintons when they were in the white house and he said he ran he ran again and he ran again and he won you have to hand it to him this is the guy that does not give up he does not quit he never ever quits but he watched the clintons  and im sure they will be thrilled to hear that  but that actually got him into politics which is interestingso then we make these horrible deals iran deal horrible deal we got 150 billion  and how about 400 million  think of it 400 million in cash different currencies different denominations now lot of people say that money went toward terrorim nicer than that see i dont have that horrible thought process that some people have in this room have i say some of it went to terror but a lot of it went into their bank accounts believe me that the way it is it went into their pockets can you imagine these guys sitting there with 400 million in cash you think theyre giving that money to terror they are giving that money to them and i guess terror got some of it but most of it they kepti mean the concept of paying 400 million in cash is mind boggling i mean you wouldnt think  who can authorize such a thing where did they get it what did they do go to a bank teller and say give me 400 million in cash i want to in euros i want it in swiss francs wrap it up we will come back in 10 minutesi mean it is just inconceivable so we are witnessing a horror show in this country and throughout the world you look at what is going on throughout the world with these same people these people funding terror  these people are funding terrorism for us to have given 400 million to basically free our hostagesnow obama just like he lied about obamacare which was a tremendous lie that was a tremendous lie remember you can keep your plan you can keep your doctor really how many people have been able to keep the doctor or their plankeep your plan keep your doctor  not working that way folks it is a disaster by the way it is going to be repealed and replaced 100 percent and  and honestly i hope i win because we will do a great job we are going to make america great again were going to make america great again but i actually think that regardless of who wins obamacare is going to fold in any event it is so expensive people cant afford it and the country cant afford it other than that it is just wonderful so in texas they just had almost a 60 percent increase now the increases are starting to come out the big increase is going to be announced on november 1st the election is november 8th folks they want to delay it because it is electionchanging it is a messit is election changing and they want to change it and we cant let that happenbecause the numbers  and i can see some of the numbers already  the numbers are going to be astronomical they are going to be astronomical theyre going to be so big so horrible and the health care you know the plan is terrible it terrible and were going to take care of everybody but were going to end up with a great plan that costs much less money for the people and much less money for the countrythis plan is a total rip it does not work so it going to fall because economically it is a disaster for the country toobut what about people where they said they had a 30 40 50 60 percent increase and it going to be worse than that i predict on november 1stso wed better get smart and wed better start thinking properlynow i want to talk about what is going on at the borders because money oh were going to build itso listen so we have people coming to our country that should not be coming to our country  we have thousands and thousands of people from certain terrorist states from certain parts of the world that we are allowing to come into our countrymost of the politicians almost all of them dont even know where they are where they are being put they know nothing about these people this could be the great trojan horse of all time and hillary wants thousands more to come in over and above obama rightso tall  and the wall is getting taller every day if you think of this i just wrote this the obamaclinton foreignpolicy has handed huge portions of iraq libya and syria to isis huge portions it has undermined stability in egypt and you know what they have to do over there and empowered iran as never before iran three years ago was  was dying in fact when they were marching in the streets if obama would have just encouraged them a little more it would have been taken over by the peoplebut obama played ball with the thugs that are running it right now think of this think of this look look were making a deal and the deal is not made and they are dancing in the streets of iran saying how stupid the americans are to be making this dealthe leaders and in particular the leader of iran is calling us stupid and the deal means nothingand yesterday i think he just said that the united states is essentially nothingthis is our  this is our great great partnerbut when you have somebody  if i was making this deal and if the other side was bragging about it the deal wasnt made im not making that deal im not making it im walkingbut we kept it going and we should have never ever started negotiating that deal until we had our hostages back ok we should have walked we should have doubled up the sanctions and walked and they would have  and i say it before the plane reached new york city or washington you could just turn it around because theyll call you theyll say let go take your hostagesbut when you think about it you probably read today and yesterday one of the hostages was waiting for a very long period of time now obama said that it had nothing to do with the hostages that he would not do that for kidnappershe would not do that for kidnapping ok no no think of that you have got to think about it he wouldnt do it  now it was the same day right same day we have to be exactly accurate because theyll catch us right same daythe money came in and one of the hostages a good guy i saw him interview on television good guy hard time btu didnt he say he waited forever he waited and somebody said nope we are waiting for either something or a plane to come inand here obama stands up yesterday and for seven minutes is telling us one thing had nothing to do with the other just a lie you know at least be truthful and were talking about the same day 400 million and we could have had something that would have been a much better deal and you know what im all in favor of deals when it gets to nuclear but we could have made it  we should have walked and we should have walked with 150 too we have said sorry we dont have the money cant pay we dont have the money we owe almost 20 trillionim sorry fellas we love you we think youre the greatest guys on earth but we cant give you the money we dont have it and they will get angry and they will be upset and two days later youll be back negotiatingyou just saved yourself 150 billion right hundred and  150 billion so we have terrorists pouring into our country we have people coming in i dont know if you saw this in maine  and maine knows because maine is  i was up there yesterday  a great place a great governor great governor paul is doing a great joband i think the most important issue facing civilization right now is radical islamic terrorism and we have a president that refuses to use the term and we have crooked hillary who does not want to use it now she being forced to use it by medid you notice she gave a speech she said i will use it she called it i think radical islam but she said i will use it i will just like the transpacific partnership she called it the gold standard it is a horror showit almost as bad or maybe it going to worse than nafta signed by her husband which cleaned out many of the states in our country cleaned them out from manufacturing moved to mexico and other places nafta a total disasternafta signed by bill clinton he never suffered the ravages because he signed it then he got out and other people did suffer with itbut we are going to renegotiate nafta and if they dont want to make a great deal for us so we get our jobs back at least a lot of them if we cant make a great deal  and she cant do that by the way if she wanted tonumber one her donors would not let her her special interests would never let her her lobbyists would never let hernumber three she could not do it anyway even if she wanted tobut were going to renegotiate and did you hear her the other day after years of saying how wonderful it is even though you look at new england and you look at new york state and you look at pennsylvania and ohio if you look at a lot of other places one of the reasons i won indiana so big  well one of the reasons was the great bobby knight okbobby knight in indiana that gold standard right as she said about tpp but one of the reasons i won was because carrier air conditioning was moving to mexico from indiana and they let go of 1400 peopleand ive been talking about this and i know how to stop it and youve heard me before so easy to stop there have to be consequences when mexico takes our companies and not only mexico there have to be consequences when china devalues its currency so that our companies can no longer compete with china even though we make better producti have friends who are manufacturers we make better product they cant get their product into china and when a few times arise where they can they have to pay an incredible tax beyond what anybody would even think costs but yet we open our doors and just throw away your stuff and we lose our jobs and it is very very saidbut look as many know a major destination  maine has become a major destination for somali refugees we admit hundreds of thousands of refugees into the united states from many of the most dangerous and unstable regions in the world and you are getting them here too folks you just dont know it because you just dont knowanybody in this room  anybody in this room from a terror territory all right a practice  and this is a practice which will continue under hillary clinton except it will expand five six seven fold i dont get it i mean i know they will vote democrat ok that what i know but they will not be voting for a long timei just  i dont get it how can anybody even think this way now the washington times reported of the somali refugees  the program in minnesota  that the effort to resettle large groups of somali refugees is having the unintended consequence of creating an enclave of immigrants with high unemployment that is both stressing the state safety net  tremendous problems for safety  and creating a rich pool of potential recruiting targets for the islamic terror groupsarent we smart we are having this problem across our refugee and immigration programs here are some of the examples  i will give you a few examples and this came out of the senate subcommittee just recently the boston bombers  remember those horrible disgusting people the boston bombers arrived through the political asylum processthe younger brother applied for citizenship and was naturalized on september 11 2012 the older brother had a pending application for citizenship and look what happened we took them in look what happened arent we smartthe moroccan national who came to the united states on a student visa was arrested for plotting to blow up a university in a federal courthouse great a uzbek refugee living in idaho was arrested and charged with providing support to a terrorist organization in the form of teaching terror recruits how to build massive and very dangerous bombs we let him inan immigrant from syria who later applied for and received us citizenship was accused by federal prosecutors of planning to go to a military base in texas and kill three or four american soldiers execution style if possible  more than that if at all possiblea college student who immigrated from somalia who later applied and received us citizenship attempted to blow up a christmas tree lighting ceremony in oregonan immigrant from afghanistan who later applied for and received us citizenship and a legal permanent resident from the philippines were convicted for plotting to join al qaida and the taliban in order to kill as many americans as possible  as many as possiblean iraqi immigrant who later applied for and received us citizenship was arrested for lying to federal agents about pledging allegiance to isis his travels to syria and how many americans he wanted to killtwo immigrants from pakistan who later applied for and received us citizenship were sentenced to decades long prison sentences for plotting to detonate a bomb  and a very big bomb in the middle of new york cityan immigrant from yemen who later applied for and received us citizenship was arrested for trying to join isis he was also charged with attempting to illegally buy firearms to try to shoot as many american military personnel as possibleall right folks so i just say what are we doing what are we doing and hillary clinton wants more and more to pour in you can almost say you know politics aside whether you are a democrat whether you are a liberal a republican a conservative what are they doing i dont care who you are what the hell are they doing so we are going to have strong borders our southern border is going to be very powerful we are going to stop the drugs from pouring into wisconsin and every place else the heroin epidemic is beyond belief in new hampshire a great place that is where i realized the extent of what is going on i met with the people of new hampshire and they tell me the biggest problem they have is heroin i said it cant be with the beautiful lakes and streams it so beautiful right and their biggest problems heroin i said you have to be kidding that cant be right  and it was their youth is being poisoned and then you go to massachusetts and you go to north carolina and south carolina and you come here you come here  i just left iowa you go to iowa and you see the tremendous problems they have with heroin and drugs that pour in from the southern border and look here the story we are going to have strong borders we are going to have a wall it will be a big and powerful wall  a big powerful wall you know that hillary clinton wanted a wall a number of years ago she wanted a wall and the primary research as we understand it looking back not that long ago she wanted a wall you know walls do work folks all you have to do is ask israel all you have to do is ask some of the nations that are in europe right now that are building wallsyou know it sort of interesting obama talks about there will be no wall but in the white house which he just said which is true they want to build essentially a wall they want to build a fence a lot bigger and a lot higher and a lot strongeryou know it is interesting i say dont build that fence right dont build that fence because they say walls dont work  fences dont work dont build that fencewhen hillary doesnt want to let you have your guns she is surrounded by people like this that have more firepower on them than any human beings on earth and i think she doesnt want to have guns i think that all of her bodyguards and all of her secret service should immediately give up their weapons ok i mean it they should immediately give up their weapons they should immediately give up those weapons and if somebody comes at you with a gun you just try to talk them out of it i guess you got to do some quick talkingyou got to do some quick talking hillary i dont think even hillary with her phony lies and disgusting habits i dont think hillary could get away with that one so we are going to have a little contrast and i did this very quickly but it is so simple hillary wants to raise taxes trump is going to lower taxes very substantially the biggest tax decrease of all on business and on personhillary wants to significantly expand regulations trump is going to get rid of many many many regulations which by the way are stopping your businesses both small and big from succeeding from expanding and more than anything from starting you cant start a business today the regulations are so onerous and horriblehillary wants to shut down energy production  trump wants to expand it significantly and well start paying off our debt hillary wants to essentially abolish the second amendment take away your right  donald trump will protect it more so than any president that has ever served crooked hillary wants far left activities judges forced over there by bernie and by pocahontas who will destroy our constitution i want judges who will support and defend our constitution as close by the way to justice scalia who was great as we could get ok hillary wants to open our borders just open them up because her special interests and donors want it that way there are reasons i understand that i want to totally secure our borders but i want people to come in but they come in through a process and they come in legally hillary wants to invade foreign countries you ever see the one where she says donald trump with the nuclear  im  i didnt want the war in iraq and im on record i didnt want the war in iraq i didnt want all of  what theyve done and i said if you read esquire magazine from a long time ago youll see everything i said was exactly right it going to destabilize the middle easti said the meanest toughest group of people the people that hate the united states and its people the most theyre going to take it over that exactly what happening theyre taking over the oil theyre taking over the land theyre taking over everything i didnt want it but im always being accused like the war hog they think im a tough guy the war hog rightthey think she wants to be tough with russia so she said well donald trump likes putin i dont know putin folks i dont know i hope i like him i hope he likes me because id love to get along with russia ok love to but i dont know but she goes donald trump donald trump  think about it  wants to befriend putin and other things she said right and im saying to myself what wrong with that that goodbut she going to be the tough one see she going to be the tough one she going to play with nuclear weapons you know they have all the nukes nice nukes she going to be the tough oneill tell you what you put her in the office of the president  you know she hates putin and putin hates her right that what i hear no no  putin probably doesnt respect her more than anything else but putin hates her but she going to be tough were going to be tough with russia  oh were going to be tough right let me tell you were in a different world today folks were in a different worldbut she makes it sound like im this tough guy that will have a temperament you know she uses the word  you know who gave her the word her people that write the speeches well say trump with a temperamentthey said trump in a speech with tweets ive got  ive got between facebook and twitter like almost 21 22 million people it an asset it an asset i tweet well but  but she said  she made the statement during her speech you know i heard it barely because i was falling asleep you couldnt watch it all right so remember that one hillary wants to invade foreign countries look at libya look at that we did a great job there you know a spot hit on gaddafi maybe but i mean even that what the hell do we get out of this it a disaster then you have benghazi then you have isis  then you have isis  then you have isis taking over the oil large portions of the oil and it some of the finest oil in the world and you have isis grabbing itwe dont know what were doing we have people that dont know what were doing we have people that militarily  in fact they said well who is your military consultants and i give them names but theyre not working now you know theyre not working now and i said of course theyre not working now look what working now people have gotten us havoc who the hell wants the people who are working now i mean you know a lot of it common sense and a lot of it instinct and she has very bad judgment she got no instinct whatsoever and when i was asked on one of the big networks about nato they said what do you think of nato now you know it not like it was my primary subject in all fairness ive only been doing this for 12 months now it actually almost 14 months hard to believe rightbut nato  so i said i know enough and sometimes knowing a little is better than knowing too much you understand you cant see the forest through the trees right so i said nato in my opinion is obsolete because it not covering terrorism obsolete for that reason and also you have many countries that arent paying their fair share theyre not paying what theyre supposed to be paying and were protecting those guys and were supposed to get into world war iii for all these countries that arent paying their fair share and even the commander of nato  and i so respect what he did he came out the other day and he said donald trump is right we have cut you see that right did you see the letter  the big story donald trump is right im sure obama was thrilled when he saw that donald trump is right you have countries that arent paying and he said how he goes in and he talks to them he says look youve got to pay your bills i have budgets  which is true and i have to go back to congress and i have to say what happeningthey dont pay their bills though because people dont ask properly and they probably say to the president or whoever may handle the country sir we owe the united states millions of dollars were ready to pay oh have they asked for the money no theyll pay okbut i will say the commander of nato said i was right and then you have these people back here  stupid people  right here they said donald trump  now theyre the worst theyre the worst they said donald trump  donald trump doesnt like nato he is going to abandon nato that not what i said i said theyve got to pay theyve got to paynow you have to walk you may have to walk but theyve got to pay were going to get in world war iii for all these countries that are laughing at the stupidity of the united states right no theyve got to pay and they probably will in all fairnessbut hillary said about japan  because japan were defending japan you know that right now in all fairness before i came alone put yourself back three years ago did anybody know that we defend japan raise your hand who knew all right there about 12 percentnot bad i think some of you are lying ok i think some of you are related to hillary rodham clinton i think some of you are lying but we defend japan and a man comes up general or something a few months ago i remember so vividly and he said at a news conference because they were embarrassed because i kept saying theyve got to pay their way and if they dont  if they dont you always have to be prepared to walk you have to do thatyou know we dont want to do that i understand the reason itd be nice to have them but you know this isnt again 40 years ago we owe 20 trillion were defending all these  we defend japan we defend germany we defend saudi arabia you think they have the money to pay  how about we have military bases that we rent  we pay rent to saudi arabia to protect them no no think of it think of it think of the stupidity think of the stupidity so this general comes up has a news conference a few months ago and he said mr trump doesnt understand that japan is paying 50 percent of the cost to defend themso a reporter goes up who i think is there and said to me mr trump wed like your comment they say that japan is paying 50 percent of the cost to defend and i said why arent they paying 100 percent the reporter said ok not a bad question now here the problem with the hillary  hillary rotten clinton here the problem here is  that why she changed her last  that why she doesnt want to use the name anymore because everybody was saying that i dont know ive been saying itbut look here is  here is why it doesnt work for hillary she saw that i said that we have to get reimbursed for our costs at least rightjapan economic behemoth germany  see how well theyre doing  economic behemoth saudi arabia nothing but moneythey were making 1 billion a day with their high oil prices now theyre making a fortune the same thing economic behemoth why are defending them and why arent we being fully reimbursed now if we do that your budget already is starting to look real good ok you know you have budgets so we losing our assurance we have an 800 billion trade deficit folkswe trade with companies we have a deficit with other countries think of it  800 billion a year trade deficit do we make the deals nowith china 505 billion trade deficit and they cheat us because they devalue their currency all the time whenever it gets a little bit tough devalue devalue and our companies cant compete with that rightso here the thing so hillary says about japan how dare he not not stay with our allies how dare he not do thati will never abandon our allies ever ever ever now how do you negotiate when youre telling somebody will never going to leave we may have to leavelook japan has problems because you have the maniac in north korea making missiles but i mean you know so well get itnow south korea it is an economic behemoth you cant buy television that is not made in south korea except sony which is made in japan which has sort of lost its way whether it is lg or samsung i order thousands of television sets you cant buy them in the united states id love to show me one company one of the pundits said they do make them there a companyand he showed me it a little company what they do is all the parts come in for  from all over the world they put them together and they give you a television that doesnt work and nobody ever heard of it and then i put it into a luxury hotel and everybody complains rightso you cant say to people when youre negotiating  because were talking about tremendous billions and billions of dollars you cant say to people  you cant say to people when youre negotiating well never leave youthink of this were going to never leave you we love you well never leave you could you pay more no were not going to pay anymore youre not going to leave us why should we pay moreso there a chance well have to leave and there a chance that you know japan will have to take over this monster and figure it out were very far away it very expensiveyou know we have a treaty with japan and if the united states is attacked they dont have to do anything but if japan is attacked we have to go in there will our full force and might and who the hell knows what going to happen rightworld war iii who knows what going to happen but if were attacked they dont have to do anything you tell me who makes these dealsit like sergeant bergdahl right so we trade a dirty rotten traitor where five or maybe even six people were killed when he deserted and we knew that they were killed and we knew that he was a traitor we trade for five of the greatest killers the greatest killers in the middle east the five people that they wanted the most that is our dealso we get a traitor and they get five people that are right now most of them already back on the battlefields trying to kill everybody including usno more folks that is called the five for one president that  that is the same guy that made the deal for 400 million the other guys couldnt leave the airport the hostages and then all of a sudden they were able to leaveand then you watched him yesterday saying that can you believe it this had nothing to do with that ok just a coincidence no no just a coincidence  no you know she is unfit to serve as president for a lot of reasons he is unfit also he has done so bad he has been so incompetent we have doubled our debt during his  think of it over the years of our country  over the years of our country he gets in and in eight years by the time his term is up we will have doubled our national debtthink of it so we have to win this election this is a very important election i do not need to do this folks believe me i could be elsewhere right now i love being with youbut i could be elsewhere i could be  i might be in wisconsin just a different location ok but i felt i had to do it i want to give back i will get back give back im going to give back im going to give

corruptionhillary clinton is the most corrupt person ever to run for presidentnewlyreleased fbi documents made public today reveal just how deep the corruption goes the undersecretary of state patrick kennedy pressured the fbi to unclassify emails from hillary illegal server in other words the state department was trying to coverup hillary crime of sending classified information on a server our enemies could easily access by trying to reverse the classificationthis is a criminal conspiracy  a conspiracy that included hillary deleting and bleaching of 33000 emails the disappearance of 13 phones 2 boxes of email evidence gone missing and the destruction of laptops in a secret deal with the fbiremember also that hillary lied under oath to congress saying she had never sent or received classified information on her insecure sever and pretended not to know that the letter c meant confidential information that was classified hillary then told the fbi she couldnt remember 39 times and then in written testimony last week under oath said she couldnt remember another 21 timeswe are witnessing a criminal enterprise that has turned our government into a vehicle for the clinton personal profit at your expensebut it gets even worsethe fbi documents show that undersecretary of state patrick kennedy made the request for altering classification as part of a quid pro quo this is felony corruption undersecretary kennedy needs to resignclinton cronies have sacrificed your security your family safety and your country safety as though it meant nothing at allthis is magnitudes worse than watergate and were going to put an end to it on november 8thbut there still more another series of emails shows top officials in the clinton campaign scheming to take massive sums of money from foreign lobbyists one of the emails from a top hillary official said quote take the money!! with two exclamation points this is money bundled by people registered as lobbyists on behalf of foreign governmentsremember we are competing in a rigged election  the media is trying to rig the election by giving credence to false stories that have no validity and making it front page news only to poison the minds of the american voters the media is an extension of the clinton campaign as wikileaks proved  hillary even got the questions and answers in advance of a major debatea new report from the center for public integrity shows that 96 of socalled journalists and reporters who donated this cycle gave their money to hillary clinton they even want to try and rig the election at the polling booths where so many cities are corrupt and voter fraud is all too commonthe following comes straight from pew researchquote approximately 24 millionone of every eightvoter registrations in the united states are no longer valid or are significantly inaccuratequote more than 18 million deceased individuals are listed as votersquote approximately 275 million people have registrations in more than one statethen there is the issue of illegal immigrants voting the following comes from a 2014 report from the washington post the article was entitled could noncitizens decide the november election here are some excerptsquote more than 14 percent of noncitizens in both the 2008 and 2010 samples indicated that they were registered to votequote because noncitizens tended to favor democrats obama won more than 80 percent of the votes of noncitizens in the 2008 sample we find that this participation was large enough to plausibly account for democratic victories in a few close elections noncitizen votes could have given senate democrats the pivotal 60th vote needed to overcome filibusters in order to pass healthcare reform and other obama administration priorities in the 111th congress it is also possible that noncitizen votes were responsible for obama 2008 victory in north carolina obama won the state by 14177 votes so a turnout by 51 percent of north carolina adult noncitizens would have provided this victory marginour system is also rigged by the donors giving hundreds of millions to hillary clinton campaignthe reason hillary clinton pushes for nafta or the transpacific partnership and for completely open borders is because her international donors control her every moveif we let the clinton cartel run this government history will record that 2017 was the year america lost its independencewe will not let that happenit is time to drain the swamp in washington dcthat is why i am proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once againwhen bill clinton came into office he signed an executive order saying if you work for the white house or a federal agency you cant lobby the government for 5 years after you leave but then president clinton did what the clintons always do  he rigged the system on his way out clinton lifted the executive order so the clintons and their cronies like john podesta could start raking in cashso here is what i am announcing tonight first i am going to reinstitute a 5year ban on all executive branch officials lobbying the government for 5 years after they leave government service i am going to ask congress to pass this ban into law so that it cannot be lifted by executive ordersecond i am going to ask congress to institute its own 5year ban on lobbying by former members of congress and their staffsthird i am going to expand the definition of lobbyist so we close all the loopholes that former government officials use by labeling themselves consultants and advisors when we all know they are lobbyistsfourth i am going to issue a lifetime ban against senior executive branch officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign governmentand fifth i am going to ask congress to pass a campaign finance reform that prevents registered foreign lobbyists from raising money in american electionsnot only will we end our government corruption but we will end the economic stagnationmy plan for the economy can be summed up in three simple words jobs jobs jobsat the center of my plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals47 million americans are in poverty and 45 million americans are on food stampswe have nearly an 800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world and the worst socalled recovery since the great depressionit the clintons who gave us nafta and the clintons who gave us china entry into the world trade organizationbriggs & stratton has cut thousands of wisconsin manufacturing jobs and moved them to chinage healthcare recently closed its milwaukee location and shipped the jobs to mexicojohnson controls shuttered its plants in milwaukee and west allis and moved the jobs to mexico and chinathe list goes on and onwe are living through the greatest jobs theft

betrayalthis is our chance to solve all of the problems that have gone unsolved for so many yearsfor how long have people been saying washington is broken and controlled by special intereststhis is the year we can finally fix itthat because change has to come from outside of our broken and corrupt systemwe will never fix our rigged system by relying on the people who rigged it in the first placewe will never solve our problems by relying on the politicians who created our problemsso to every american who has been waiting for real change your wait is over  your moment of liberation is at hand a vote for trump is a vote to restore democracy to heal our economy and to bring millions of jobs back into every forgotten stretch of this countrythe change will begin my first day in officefirst we are going to eliminate every unconstitutional executive order and restore the rule of law to our landthen we are going to begin implementing plans for construction of a wall along our southern border this will keep out the violent cartels and gangs as well as their drugs that are poisoning our youthbut that just the beginningi am going to ask congress to send me a bill to repeal and replace obamacare under senate rules that bill can be passed with 51 votes  meaning a republican congress and a republican president can save americans from this disaster in a single afternoonit going to be a very busy first dayi am going to instruct the department of state to immediately suspend the syrian refugee resettlement program and develop plans for the construction of a safe zone in the region my opponent wants a 550 increase in syrian refugees she is running to be america angela merkeli am also going to notify all countries that refuse to take back dangerous illegal immigrants who have committed crimes in this country that they will lose access to our visa programs if they continue to do so this is the measure that is called for under current law and i will enforce itthe secretary of state is required to take this action but hillary clinton refused to do so  resulting in thousands of criminal aliens being released into us communitiesfurthermore i will direct every agency in government to begin identifying all wasteful jobkilling regulations and they are going to be removed  this will include lifting the restrictions on american energyi will also notify our nafta partners of my intention to renegotiate the deal and will withdraw from the tpp before it can be ratified we are going to bring these jobs back to north carolinahillary clinton supported nafta she supported china entry into the world trade organization and she supported the tpp she just does whatever her donors tell her to doin a trump administration we will negotiate trade deals on behalf of american workers  not on behalf of global corporationswe will work to ensure farmers in north carolina have the tools they need to thrive at home and compete on a level playing field in foreign markets  and that means negotiating fair trade deals that put america firstcrucially i am also going to convene my top generals and give them a simple instruction they will have 30 days to submit to the oval office a plan for defeating isis any nation who shares in this goal will be our friend in this missionfor years we have been caught up in endless wars and conflicts under the leadership of failed politicians and a failed foreign policy establishment in washington dc the same people who made every wrong decision in iraq afghanistan libya syria egypt china and russia are the same people who are advising hillary clintoni am proud instead to have the support of our warfighting generals active duty military officers and top military experts who know how to win  and know how to keep us out of endless wartoday 88 retired us generals and admirals signed a letter of endorsementthat one of the biggest differences between me and hillary clinton she favors what has been called military adventurism  rushing to invade countries displacing millions of families then inviting the refugees into our country  creating power vacuums filled by terrorist groups like isisi believe in a foreign policy based on our national interests that focuses on american security and regional stability  instead of using our military to create democracies in countries with no democratic historywe will work to form partnerships overseas based on a longterm strategy of defeating radical islamic terrorismwe will first have to reverse the damage inflicted by hillary clinton  her legacy of failure in the middle east russia and asia has made americans less safe than ever beforeas part of our plan to avoid and prevent foreign conflicts we are going to rebuild our depleted military this is the ultimate deterrentwe will be guided by those three famous words peace through strengthi will ask congress to eliminate the sequester and immediately reinvest in our military right now we have the smallest air force since 1947 the smallest army since 1939 and one of the smallest navy since 1917like the cold war we also need to fight this battle by collecting intelligence and then protecting our classified secrets hillary clinton has taught us all how much of a problem we have with cybersecuritywe cant have someone in the oval office who doesnt understand the meaning of the word confidentialthe new revelations about hillary clinton from the justreleased fbi documents make more clear than ever that she fails to meet the minimum standard for running for public office if she applied for a lowlevel job at the state department today she couldnt even get a security clearanceher conduct is disqualifyinglet run through what we discovered in those fbi documents it important and were hoping matt lauer will ask about it on wednesday night at the townhallit clear from the fbi report that hillary clinton lied about her handling of confidential information she repeatedly told the country that she understood the classified system then she told the fbi she didnt understand that the letter c meant confidential in the documents she emailedon 39 separate occasions she said she couldnt recall details about her mishandling of classified information and she couldnt even name one step she took to make sure foreign hackers couldnt get into her server keep in mind that her insecure emails included emails about the drone programit also clear from the fbi report that hillary clinton and her top aides knowingly destroyed evidence and coveredup their actions after her private server was revealed last march her staff deleted all the emails and wiped it clean using a software designed to prevent any recovery called bleachbitthey used hammers to destroy phones so they couldnt be turned over later  and by the way who uses 12 different phones in 4 years the only people who use that many phones are usually involved in very very shady activitypeople who have nothing to hide dont smash phones with hammers people who have nothing to hide dont bleach their emails or destroy evidence to keep it from being publicly archived as required under federal lawhillary clinton failed to turn over thousands of documents then tried to shield her criminal conduct by having her chiefofstaff declare herself to be hillary clinton private attorneyhillary and her top aides told the fbi and others in related lawsuits that they couldnt recall or remember key facts hundreds of different times  and that in addition to the guy who set up the server pleading the 5thno one takes all the risks hillary clinton took unless they are trying to cover up massive crimeshillary clinton was using the state department to dole out special favors and access to her friends and donorsit called payforplayone example of payforplay is what the clinton did in haiti let me stop here for a second and say how much we love and appreciate the haitianamerican community in florida and across our country we send our prayers to the many still suffering in haiti from the earthquakebut while haiti has suffered the clintons and their pals have cashed inbill and hillary brothers have signed housing deals in haiti and one wound up on the board of a gold mining companyclinton foundation donors have seen the clintons pave the way for their investmentsin one deal hillary clinton set aside environmental and labor rules to help a south korean company with a record of violating workers rights set up what amounts to a sweat shop in haitithe facility has produced only a fraction of the jobs it promised and faces reports of wage theftpeople are asking where did all the money gothis november it is up to the american people to stop the clintons from raiding america the way they have raided so many other people and placesone of the groups in america that have been harmed the most by hillary clinton policies are africanamericans she sees them only as votes not as people worthy of a better futuremany africanamericans have succeeded so greatly in this country we will honor and protect their achievements that includes lowering taxes for our small business owners to fifteen percentbut millions of africanamericans in our inner cities remain trapped in poverty joblessness and failing schoolsthe democratic party has run the inner cities for fifty sixty seventy years and more4 in 10 africanamerican children in poverty including 45 of those under the age of six58 of africanamerican youth are not working2900 people have been shot in chicago since the beginning of the yearnationwide africanamericans are nearly 60 of the murder victims under the age of 22this is a national crisis  and anybody who fails to understand that is not fit to seek the presidency of the united statesto those suffering in crime and poverty i say give donald j trump a chance what do you have to lose by embracing our platform of change we are going to bring back your jobs rebuild your cities and give parents and students school choice i will never ever ever take you for grantedwe are going to push a new civil rights agenda we believe every american has the right to a safe community a great

35,thank you it wonderful to be back in north carolinacome november 8 we are going to win this state and we are going to win the white housewe are going to bring back your jobswe are going to cut your taxeswe are going to renegotiate our disastrous trade dealsand we are going to protect our country from radical islamic terrorismover the weekend there were islamic terrorist attacks in minnesota and new york city and in new jersey these attacks were made possible because of our extremely open immigration system which fails to properly vet and screen the individuals or families coming into our countryattack after attack  from 9/11 to san bernardino to orlando  we have seen how failures to screen who is entering the united states puts all of our citizens in dangerso let me state this very clearly immigration security is national securitymy opponent has the most open borders policy of anyone ever to seek the presidency as secretary of state she allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released into our communities because their home countries wouldnt take them backnow obama wants to bring in an additional 110000 refugees and hillary wants a 550 increase in syrian refugees altogether hillary clinton plan would bring in 620000 refugees in her first term  with no effective way to screen or vet them her plan would cost 400 billion dollars in terms of lifetime welfare and entitlement coststhis isnt just a matter of terrorism but also quality of life we want to make sure we are only admitting people into our country who love our countrymy highest duty as president is to protect our citizens and to uphold the constitution of the united states i will honor that duty to the fullest extent every single day  and i will never waver in that sacred obligationit just a plain fact that our current immigration system makes no real attempt to determine the views of the people entering since 9/11 hundreds of immigrants and their children have been implicated in terrorism and terroristrelated activity in the united statesnow we learn that another 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted citizenship despite pending deportation orders this is unacceptablealtogether there are nearly 1 million individuals in the united states with deportation orders who have not yet been removedin the 20th century the united states defeated fascism nazism and communismnow we must defeat radical islamic terrorismyet my opponent wont even say the words radical islamic terrorism in fact hillary clinton talks tougher about my supporters than she does about islamic terrorists she calls the patriotic americans who support our campaign  many of them cops and soldiers  deplorable and irredeemable has she ever talked that way about radical islam or about those who oppress and murder women and gays overseas has hillary clinton ever called people who support these practices deplorable and irredeemable in many countries overseas nonbelievers face the death penalty  where is hillary condemnation herelet ask hillary clinton how many people who subscribe to radical islamic views and support the oppression of nonbelievers would you call deplorable or irredeemable  or are those words reserved only for hardworking americans that truly love their country and that support donald trumpamerica can never elect a president like hillary clinton who apparently with her choice of words thinks decent american citizens are a bigger threat than radical islamic terroristsanyone who cannot name our enemy is not fit to lead this country anyone who cannot condemn the hatred oppression and violence of radical islam lacks the moral clarity to serve as our presidentthe commanderinchief of this nation must speak with moral clarity and conviction our system of government is the best in the world and as your president i will defend our values  and speak out against all those who assault our values in any wayit also time to remember one very important word accountability all this disaster with isis happened on hillary clinton watchher policies in iraq libya and syria are responsible for the rise of isis her attacks on me are all meant to deflect from her record of unleashing this monstrous evil upon usher timetable withdrawal from iraq her push for regime change in libya and syria her open borders policies  these are the actions that unleashed the isis disasterso she will say and do anything to distract from that record of total failureher claim that my opposition to radical islamic terrorism is a recruiting tool demonstrates a level of ignorance about the terror threat that is disqualifyingwhen she says my opposition to radical islamic terror provides aid and comfort to the enemy we know that hillary clinton has once again demonstrated that she is dangerously unfit for office her comments are not only reckless but beneath the dignity of the office she seeksisis is torturing murdering executing and exterminating people in a campaign of genocide and what is hillary clinton suggestion that we should censor our vocabulary so as not to upset these butchers i have news for hillary clinton refusing to call out radical islam will not lessen the danger it will only increase and embolden the danger  just like we have seen during her disastrous and failed tenure as secretary of statethe rise of isis is hillary clinton foreign policy legacysecretary clinton has helped to topple regimes displace millions and then opened the door to isis to enter our country how is this a smart policyhillary clinton decisions overseas have left us with the threat we face today  and her immigration policies will invite this threat onto our shoreswe must stop the massive inflow of refugees  which hillary clinton is trying to drastically increase we should temporarily suspend immigration entirely from regions where safe and adequate screening cannot occurpew polling shows that in many of the countries from which we draw large numbers of immigrants extreme views about religion  such as the death penalty for those who leave the faith are commonplaceit is the job of a responsible government to admit only those who we expect to succeed and flourish here and to become part of our incredible home hillary clinton disagrees with this common sense rule and it one more reason why she can never be presidentit time to break with the corruption the bad judgement and the failures of the pastit is time to have a new american futurewe are going to change our immigration system to reflect american valueswe are going to stop the policy of regime change overseas and instead focus on working with our allies on a military campaign to utterly destroy isis and defeat islamic terrorism this will not only require military warfare but also financial warfare cyber warfare and ideological warfarebut to win this struggle we need to be strong at homewe are going to rebuild our countryand at the center of that

36,thanks maria for that introduction and for the work you and your organization do to honor these stolen american lives  and to advocate for justice on behalf of all american victimsi am honored to be here today and to shine a national spotlight on a group of victims who have been forced into the shadows your stories are not featured in the news you have no demonstrators taking to the streets on your behalf you have no special interests taking up your cause and politicians ignore your cries for help but i never willi have met many incredible people during the course of this campaign but nothing has moved me more deeply than the time ive spent with the families of the remembrance project and the incredible strength and courage youve shown in your often lonely fight for justiceyou are heroes and your actions will help us to save the next thousand american citizens from losing their brothers sisters sons daughters or parentsthe most fundamental duty of government is to protect american lives anyone who fails to understand this is not fit to hold public officeevery day our border remains open innocent americans are needlessly victimized every day sanctuary cities are left in place innocent americans are put in harm way every day we fail to enforce our laws is a day when a loving parent is at risk of losing their childit happening every single dayall across this country dining room tables have an empty seat at the family dinner table because our government abandoned its duty and failed to enforce the lawsthere are a lot of numbers in the immigration debate but let me give you the most important number of all that most important number of all is the number of american lives it is acceptable to lose in the name of illegal immigration let me tell you what that number is zeroour nation should not accept one lost american life because our country failed to enforce its laws what do you tell to the mother who just buried her daughter because someone was released at the border who should have been sent homewhat do you tell to the young boy who will grow up without a dad because a criminal was deported five times but was allowed to keep coming back into the countrywhat do you tell the wife who has lost her husband because a sanctuary city released an illegal immigrant from behind barsthis must end and it must end right now not one more american life should be given up in the name of open bordersjust look at what happened in the last few dayslast week it was reported that authorities detained an illegal immigrant in the austin area who is responsible for nearly a dozen sexual assaults and had been previously deported five times within a threeyear periodearlier this week in kansas a sheriff department master deputy was killed apparently by an illegal immigrant the driver was previously arrested for a dui in california in 2001 and for a traffic violation in kansas in 2013 deputy collins was killed only hours after his daughter fourth birthdaya few days ago two correctional officers in california were critically wounded after being shot by an illegal immigrant who overstayed his visa this individual had been convicted for child rape and was slated to be deported  but his home country refused to take him back so he was simply released one of the victims has six children is an air force veteran and a high school football coach  the other victim is a mother and a grandmotherwhen hillary clinton was secretary of state the matter of this country refusing to take back their deported citizens came before hillary clinton desk but she failed to take forceful action and ignored the federal law requiring her to suspend visas to countries that dont take back their citizensaccording to a report from the boston globe from the year 2008 through 2014 nearly 13000 criminal aliens were released back into us communities because their home countries would not take them back most of these 13000 releases occurred on hillary clinton watch  she had the power and the duty to stop it cold and she didnt do itnow my opponent will never meet with you she will never hear your stories she will never share in your painshe will only meet with the donors and the special interests and the open border advocatesher plan calls for total amnesty in the first 100 days which means obamacare social security and medicare for illegal immigrants her plan calls for catchandrelease on the border sanctuary cities ignoring visa overstays closing detention centers and a virtual end to immigration enforcement in the united states of americahillary clinton has even announced that she plans to go around congress and implement amnesty by executive order  violating our constitution and putting the entire nation in grave perilhillary clinton is the first person to ever run for the presidency of a country effectively proposing to abolish the borders around that countrybut the media doesnt want you to know any of that so theyll never ask her any questions about her plan like how shell afford to give lifetime welfare and entitlements to illegal immigrants or how many people will be victimized because of the illegal immigrants that will be released from federal custody  or at the border she not asked to explain what shell say to the american workers who lose their jobs when she prints out millions of work permits for those here against the lawyour cause and your stories are ignored by our political establishment because they are determined to keep our border open at any cost to them your presence is just too inconvenientbut help is coming on november 8th we are going to win the white house and we are going to deliver justice for every american family and every american victimtogether we will save american lives  and prevent the next thousand american parents from suffering the same fate as the people in the room todaysince 2013 alone the obama administration has allowed 300000 criminal aliens to return back into us communities  these are individuals encountered or identified by ice but who were not detained or processed for deportationaccording to the federal government own data there are more than 2 million convicted criminal illegal immigrants inside the united states right now however this figure does not even include the many individuals who have committed crimes but escaped justice fled the jurisdiction or were otherwise never caught many crimes committed by people here illegally remain open casesat the same time hundreds of individuals who have been given visas and refugee admissions into this country have subsequently been charged with terrorism we are admitting people here with no idea who they are or what they believewhether it drugs terrorism or violent crime our government is utterly failing in its core mission to defend and protect the people of this country the border patrol agents who endorsed me warned that hillary clinton plan would put the entire country in grave danger  they called it radical deeply dangerous and warned it would trigger an unprecedented national crisislet just remember our goal  to prevent the next family from suffering the same terrible fatethat is what is at stake in this electionso i am now going to invite some of the bravest people i know to come up to the stage and speakthese wounded american families have been alone but they are alone no longeri am here standing with you the american people are here standing with you and come november your long awaited day of justice will finally arrive

country a hundred percent and this is our chance to break free from the bitter failures of the past and to create a new american future to everyone watching across our nation right now to everyone who has been let down by our terrible terrible politicians i am asking for your vote on november 8th this is your chance to remove the special interests from their throne of power and to once again have a government of by and for the people no one will be left behind anymore id like to take this moment to send our thoughts and prayers to everyone at the american university in kabul afghanistan they are going through a lotwe must defeat radical islamic terrorism! anyone who will not name our enemy is not fit to lead our country eight years of obama/clinton policies have sacrificed our safety and undermined our freedom and independence our jobs have moved to other countries islamic terrorism has spread within our shores and an open border has crushed lowincome workers and threatened and i mean totally threatened our security the issues we face here in america are similar to the issues faced in britain during their referendum on membership in the european union this is the movement known as brexiton june 23rd the people of britain voted to declare their independence which is what were looking to do also folks from their international government which hasnt worked they voted to break away from rule by large corporations and media executives who believe in a world without borders they voted to reclaim control over immigration over their economy over their government working people and the great people of the uk took control of their destiny the people profiting from the rigged system and it is rigged were finding it out every single day the multinational banks the media celebrities the big donors tried to scare the british people out of voting for change the same thing is happening right here in the united states it happeningall the people benefiting from our rigged system dont want things to change they want you to believe things cant be changedand they can so easily so easily and so smartlyand we all know things have to change we have no choice and they have to change right now before the vote i said that britain would leave the eu sometimes referred to as european union and i said it and i took a lot of heat when i said it people said what does he know what does he know and guess what i was very supportive of their right to do it and to take control of their own future like exactly what were going to be voting for on november 8th hillary clinton who has been on the wrong side of history in every major decision she only made bad decisions she got bad judgment she doesnt know what she doing folks she got this one wrong tooshe got this one wrong too folks she got this one wrong too she gets them all wrong she gets them all wrong doesnt she she really got the emails wrong that i can tell you and now hillary wants to surrender america to globalism just what we dont want she wants a country without borders she wants trade deals written for the benefit of foreign corporations she wants a government that ignores the will of the people she wants to sell out american security to the clinton foundation for a big fat pile of cash it hard to tell where the clinton foundation ends and where the state department beginsaccording to the associated press more than half the meetings she took as secretary of state with people outside government were with foundation donors hillary clinton does not believe in america first we believe in america first hillary believes in donors first and special interests and lobbyists she will never straighten out our country she doesnt have the strength the stamina or the ability to straighten out our country well have four more years of obama and that just what we dont want she would rather give a job to a refugee from overseas than an unemployed american veteran or to an unemployed african american or hispanic the job of a public official is to serve and protect the citizens of the united states not illegal immigrants not foreign nationals seeking entry but the people living here lawfully today including millions of africanamerican and hispanic citizens millions millions being treated very very unfairly i can tell you thatmy focus will always be on the wellbeing of more than 300 million american citizens who call this country home and who love their country i will fight for their security i will fight for their jobs we will not let jobs be taken out of our country be ripped out of our country and moved to mexico and many other countries we will not let it happen anymore well be fighting for their jobs and well be fighting for your families that i can tell you it ends what been going on ends on november 8th we will have one american nation not divided we will be together hillary clinton has betrayed her duty to the people november 8th is our chance to redeclare american independence this is a great honor for me i am going right now to invite onto the stage the man behind brexit and a man who led brilliantly the united kingdom independence party in this fight and won despite all odds despite horrible namecalling despite so many obstacleswow! thank you nigelwhat a job! what a job he did what a job he did against all oddsthank you nigelthat was some job that he did against all odds everybody said it couldnt be done and by the way it looking like a very wise decision right now by the voters so i really congratulate nigel and i thank you for being here thank you and if i may we had some tremendous polls come out today i wont bring it up i refuse to mention it but they were very good were leading in a lot of locations thank youit time for america to recapture like you just heard to recapture our destiny our government leaders and our media have totally lost touch with the people they have they have totally lost touchyou need no better evidence of that then the fact that the media ignores the plight of americans who have lost their children to illegal immigrants but spends day after day pushing for amnesty for those here in total violation of the law we cant allow that why do our leaders spend so much time talking about how to help people here illegally theyre here illegally and they spend and they work and they try so hard to help them but they dont try helping american citizens some of whom have been devastated by what happened to their children and their families devastatedjobs wages and security for americans and the immigration policy i support as president must pass these three tests first it must improve jobs and wages for united states citizens we have people in this room who were making more money in real wages 18 years ago were not working as hard as theyre working now and theyve gotten older not supposed to be that way and in many cases and largely because of the disaster known as obamacare they have to hold two jobs not one but two jobs and in some cases three jobsnot going to happen folks not going to happensecond it must improve the safety and security for united states citizens third it must improve the quality of life for us citizens the quality of life our quality of life is going downour level of security you look back years youre more insecure now in terms of security than you were 10 15 and 20 years agohillary clinton radical immigration plan fails these tests and it fails them very very badly her push for open borders will lower the wages and kill the jobs of lawful american residents her support for catchandrelease will put innocent american lives at risk and already has just like president obama released the illegal immigrant at the border who then killed magnificent magnificent sarah rootyesterday i met with her mom michelle hillary clinton only talks about the separation of families who choose to come here illegally i want to focus on the american families who have been permanently separated from their children because of the sanctuary cities and open borders that hillary clinton so strongly supports where is the sanctuary for american children where is that sanctuary the dreamers we never talk about are the young americans why arent young americans dreamers also i want my dreamers to be young americans hillary clinton also wants to push to bring in 620000 refugees in her first term a large number of whom come from large countries where women and gays are horribly brutalized which will weaken our tolerant way of lifei only want to bring people to our country who share our values and love our people and are capable of loving america importantly i will also create millions and millions of jobs for our people we are going to cut taxes reduce regulations fix our trade deals unleash american energy and repeal and replace the horror show known as obamacare we are going to create jobs jobs jobs! i will be the greatest jobs president that god ever created believe me so were going to have millions and millions of jobs jobs like you have never seen in this country before because our jobs are being stolen from us our companies are being stolen from us our manufacturing is down by 40 percent and 50 percent and numbers that nobody even believes those days will be over if donald trump is elected president of the united states believe me rising incomes higher wages thousands of new companies all across this nation theyll come in and theyll form we are going to renegotiate the worst trade deal ever made not only in this country but anywhere in the world known as nafta and signed by bill clinton were going to stand up to china on trade were going to keep out of what will be a disastrous trade deal transpacific partnership tpp it will not happen with me it will absolutely happen with crooked hillary believe methis state has lost more than 40 percent of its manufacturing jobs since bill clinton signed nafta and it lost one in four manufacturing jobs since he put china into the world trade organization both deals supported by hillary clinton horrible deals destructive deals what those deals have done to our jobs and to our countrywe are going to bring back jobs to mississippi and in north carolina which has treated me so well and ohio and to michigan where our auto plants are leaving and leaving and leaving and going to mexico and other places and to pennsylvania where i went to school and to maryland and all across this land were going to bring our jobs back and were not going to let our jobs be taken away thank you thank youand im going to make it my personal mission to bring opportunity safety and prosperity to our very very troubled inner cities the democratic party has failed and betrayed the africanamerican community democratic crime policies education policies and economic policies have produced only more crime more broken homes and more poverty than weve ever had in those communities before nearly four in 10 africanamerican children live in poverty fiftyeight percent of africanamerican youth are not working more than 2700 people have been shot in chicago since the beginning of this year alone violent crime has risen 17 percent and in america 50 largest cities it only going one way folks and that up homicides are up nearly 50 percent in washington dc and more than 60 percent from last year in baltimorethe democratic party has taken the votes of african americans totally for granted and theyve done nothing in return theyve just assumed theyll get your support and theyve done nothing absolutely nothing to deserve itit time to give the democrats some competition for african american votes and for hispanic votes it time to rebuild the inner cities of america and do it properly it time to reject the failed leadership of a rigged political system and i was the first to use that term it a rigged disgusting system to those hurting and suffering and left behind i say what do you have to lose by trying something new what do you have to lose by voting for donald trump for president what do you have to lose i will fix the problem i will fix the problem if you keep voting for the same people you will keep getting the same horrible resultsbut i also want to talk about what you have to gain right right what do you have to gain we will create school choice and allow charter schools to absolutely thrive what else will we gain we will empower young americans to pursue their dreams of opening a small business and make it easier for them to get the credit that they need we will renegotiate our horrible trade deals to bring back jobs and opportunity and the africanamerican community and the hispanic community will be our biggest beneficiary of that we will lower taxes and unleash job creation and we will tap into trillions of dollars in new energy wealth that we never even knew we had before we will protect your jobs from illegal immigration and broken visa programs and we will rebuild the roads the bridges the infrastructure the tunnels the airports in your communities and we will rebuild it with our companies with our steel and with our labor hillary clinton is a bigot who sees people of color only as votes not as human beings worthy of a better future she going to do nothing for african americans she going to do nothing for the hispanics she only going to take care of herself her husband her consultants her donors these are the people she cares about she doesnt care what her policies have done to your communities she doesnt careremember this youve had her policies democrats running some of the inner cities for 50 70 80 even over a hundred years and look what you have right now poverty no education crime you cant walk down the street with your child were going to fix it were going to fix it hillary clinton has no remorse i will fight to create a better future for every american the hedge fund managers and wall street donors are throwing money at hillary clinton to try and stop our change agendaof course if they start looking at the polls they may stop doing that theyre going to have to start studying those polls that why you need to come out and you have to vote you have to vote that is why you must make your voice heard on november 8th have to do it another crucial issue in this race is national security hillary clinton may go down as the worst secretary of state that has ever served in that office let look back at the middle east at the very beginning of 2009 before the obama/clinton administration that i call a catastrophe took over libya was stable syria was under control iraq was experiencing a reduction in violence the group that would become what we now call isis was close to being extinguished would never have happened iran was being choked off by economic sanctionsfast forward to today after spending 4 trillion maybe 5 trillion nobody even knows how much money has been sucked out of our country what have the decisions of obama/clinton producedlibya is in ruins our ambassador and three other brave americans are dead and isis has gained a new base of operations theyre all over the worldsyria is in the midst of a totally disastrous civil war isis controls large portions of the territorya refugee crisis now threatens europe and is threatening the united states because hillary is allowing these people to pour into our country and we dont know who they are where they come from we know nothingiraq is in chaos and isis is on the looseisis has spread across the middle east and into the west at the same time isis is trying to infiltrate refugee flows into europe and definitely folks definitely i have been very good at predicting definitely to the united states iran has become the world largest state sponsor of terrorism is now flush with up to 150 billion in cash released by the united states plus another 400 million in cash cash cash ransom that president obama said had nothing to do with ransom had nothing to do with the hostages and his own people said he was wrong he lied he lied just like he said obamacare keep your plan youll keep your doctor 28 times keep your plan keep your doctor and because of that lie democrats that would have never passed it passed it and now they regret that they passed it because it is a total disaster worst of all the nuclear deal puts iran the numberone state sponsor of radical islamic terrorism on a path to nuclear weapons in short the obama/clinton foreign policy has unleashed isis destabilized the middle east and put the nation of iran which chants constantly chants death to america in a dominant position of regional power and in fact aspiring to be a dominant world power and we put them there over the last three years! this is the legacy of barack obama and hillary clinton death destruction terrorism and weakness but hillary clinton legacy does not have to be america legacy were going to end the era of nationbuilding a disastrous concept a disastrous era and create new foreign policy joined by our partners in the middle east that is focused completely on destroying isis we have no choice destroying isis we will extend a hand of friendship to any nation that will work with us in good faith on this vital missioni have a message for the terrorists trying to kill our people our citizens trying to hurt the world but trying to hurt the united states we will find you we will destroy you and we will win! thank you thank youthis is not only a military fight but it will also require cyber warfare

38,it is a privilege to be here this morning with so many distinguished members of our armed servicesbefore we get started with our q & a id like to address one of the most important aspects of america national security and that cyber securityto truly make america safe we must make cybersecurity a major priority for both the government and the private sectorcyber theft is the fastest growing crime in the united statesas president improving cyber security will be an immediate and top priority for my administrationone of the very first things i will do is to order a thorough review of our cyber defenses and weaknesses including all vital infrastructurecyberattacks from foreign governments especially china russia and north korea along with nonstate terrorist actors and organized criminal groups constitute one of our most critical national security concernshillary clinton only experience in cyber security involves her criminal scheme to violate federal law engineering a massive coverup and putting the entire nation in harm way the fact that a former senator and secretary of state claimed not to know what the letter c means is just one more example of why she unfit to hold public officethe scope of our cyber security problem is enormous our government our businesses our trade secrets and our citizens most sensitive information are all facing constant cyber attacksjust consider some of these recent hacksjp morgan chase had 73 million emails stolenebay was invaded and gave up 150 million passwordstarget was attacked and gave up 40 million credit card numbersattacks like these are happening on a regular basis both in the united states and around the world and the costs in our privacy our security and on our financial sector are extraordinaryidentify theft financial laundering as well as ransom ware  involving the extortion of a hacked institution  are all becoming increasingly commonincredibly hackers were able to obtain at least 20 million identities of people who underwent fbi background investigationsthe information hacked contains facts discovered by the fbi in doing background checks for people seeking positions with the federal government it is a treasure trove which can be easily used for blackmailthe fact that this highly classified information was so poorly protected demonstrates that cyber security is just one more area where the obama administration has failedwe should not let this be like the history of the mafia which was allowed to grow into a nationwide organization which infiltrated and corrupted so many areas of society for such a long timewe can learn from this history that when the department of justice the fbi the dea and state and local police and prosecutors were combined in task forces directed at the mafia they were able to have great success in prosecuting them seizing their business interests and removing their infiltration from legitimate areas of societyas president i will instruct the department of justice to create joint task forces throughout the united states to work together with federal state and local law enforcement authorities and international law enforcement to crush this stilldeveloping area of crimei will make certain that our military is the best in the world in both cyber offense and defense i will also ask my secretary of defense and joint chiefs to present recommendations for strengthening and augmenting our cyber commandas a deterrent against attacks on our critical resources the united states must possess the unquestioned capacity to launch crippling cyber counterattacks this is the warfare of the future america dominance in this arena must be unquestionedcyber security is not only a question of developing defensive technologies but offensive technologies as wellfor nonstate terror actors the united states must develop the ability  no matter how difficult  to track down and incapacitate those responsible we should turn cyber warfare into one of our greatest weapons against the terroriststo enhance the defense of the other agencies of government including our law enforcement agencies we will put together a team of the best military civilian and private sector cyber security experts to comprehensively review all of our cyber security systems and technologythe cyber review team will proceed with the most sensitive systems first but ultimately all systems will be analyzed and made as secure as modern technology permitsi will also require that followup reviews take place on a regular basis determined by the sensitive nature of the security involvedthe review will include providing exact recommendations for the best combination of defensive technologies tailored to specific agenciesthis will include the various methods of internal monitoring attack and penetration investigation of suspected hackers or rogue employees and identity protection for government employeesthe review team will also remain current on the constantlyevolving new methods of attack and will attempt to anticipate them and develop defenses as often as possible before major breaches occurthis group of experts will set up protocols for each agency and government officials requiring them to follow best practicesthey will also establish a training program for all government employees to make certain they understand what defenses are available and utilize them along with a continuing education program so everyone is aware of the newest methods of both attack and defensethose who violate classification rules will be held responsible to the fullest extent of the law i will appoint an attorney general who will reform the department of justice like it was necessary after watergate my attorney general will restore the integrity of the department of justicetoday is just the beginning of a long and overdue national discussion of how to protect ourselves from modern cybercrime and evolving national security threats and how to develop the cyber offense strategies necessary to gain a critical security edge in the 21st century
39,thank you thank you very much we love new hampshire i can tell you that i need to open with a very critical breaking news announcement the fbi has just sent a letter to congress informing them that they have discovered new emails pertaining to the former secretary of state hillary clinton investigationand they are reopening her case into her criminal and illegal conduct that threatens the security of the united states of america hillary clinton corruption is on a scale we have never seen before we must not let her take her criminal scheme into the oval office i have great respect for the fact that the fbi and the department of justice are now willing to have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made this was a grave miscarriage of justice that the american people fully understood and it is everybody hope that it is about to be corrected so that is a big announcement that i heard 10 minutes ago and i guess obviously most of you folks have heard about and in all fairness for all of the people that have suffered for doing so much less including just recently fourstar general james cartwright general petraeus and many others perhaps finally justice will be done

premium increase will be almost 60 percent the democratic governor said the affordable care act is no longer affordable jonathan gruber the architect of obamacare  admitted it was all a fraud and he

we didnt forget i never forgot jonathan gruberi said you know if i do this were going to run and his name came up and people forget after a week or two i said i am never going to forget jonathan gruber the architect of obamacare and what he said so we did not forget almost can you imagine it like a little more than a week before the election we didnt forget the name jonathan gruberbut the only real stupidity is that shown by our politicians who passed this monstrosity over the furious objection of certain politicians and the american voter jobkilling obamacare is just one more way the system is rigged what ive just announced previously it might not be as rigged as i thought right right the fbi i think theyre going to right the ship folks i think theyre going to right the ship and theyre going to save their reputation by doing sohillary clinton wants to double down on obamacare destroying american health care forever she wants to expand obamacare and make it even more expensive i will repeal and replace obamacare and we will replace it with a much less expensive plan and a plan that is much much better just this year hillary clinton declared obamacare is one of the greatest accomplishments of president obama the democratic party and our country well that was that turned out to be wrong do they do anything right we dont win anymore we dont i mean youre going to have such a good time starting in 17 were going to start winning again were going to start winning again because it turned out and ive been saying this from before it passed obamacare is a catastrophe beyond imagination insurers are leaving doctors are quitting companies are fleeing workers hours are being cut parttime jobs are all over the place those beautiful fulltime jobs that you used to have dont exist and deductibles are through the roof you dont get to use it we dont get rid of obamacare we have no choice but if we dont get rid of it our health care system is gone forever well never have another chanceand by the way if we dont win this election youre never going to have another chance either that i can tell you never going to happen again repealing obamacare is one of the single most important reasons we must win on november 8th but real change also means getting rid of the corruption in washington and again maybe that happened wow we have a big day no think of it i won my first primary in new hampshire and i am getting here and the news this morning is this is bigger than watergate this is bigger than watergate in my opinion this is bigger than watergate hillary bleached and deleted 33000 emails after receiving a congressional subpoena that alone to me there were more serious things done but how does it get much more but that was so obvious she gets the subpoena and she bleaches and deletes 33000 emails that to me because it was so simple you know not it not about the sale of the uranium that nobody knows what it means i know what it means to russia then she talks to me about russia 20 percent of the uranium in our country to russiabut you know the deletion of 33000 emails boy that just sort of is so out there after receiving a subpoena from the united states government she lied to congress she lied to the fbi she made 13 phones disappear some with a hammer the clinton crew gave more than 675000 to the wife of the deputy director of the fbi  and the man who was overseeing the investigation into hillary illegal server but maybe that takes care of itself right now that takes care of itself i think i think very proud that the fbi was willing to do this actually really very proud just yesterday we learned that bill clinton righthand man pushed for clinton foundation donors and other large corporations to funnel as much as 66 million in personal profit to bill and hillary clintonthis man explained that the cozy relationship between his consulting firm to foundation and clinton personal income had helped bill and hillary enrich themselves and obtain inkind services including personal travel hospitality vacations and the like the same people paying bill clinton for speeches were lobbying hillary clinton at the same the same time same time and these people are seriously corrupt terribly conflict hillary pay for play included defense contracts take raytheon when the contractor wanted big foreign arms deals they hired three lobbyists that raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for hillary last campaign and are raising money for her current campaignand by the way 50 to 1 in ads 50 to 1 and if you look at florida were winning ohio were winning iowa were winning doing great in new hampshire i think were going to have a tremendous victory in pennsylvania we better have a great victory in new hampshire please ok we will in fact when this news when this news of the fbi investigation when it just happened a little while ago they said mr trump i think theyd understand we could skip your speech in new hampshire this is so big i said i dont have the courage to skip the speech in new hampshire believe me i dont have the courage im not skipping new hampshire i never will you know when i won and you remember because i go around and we had the big rallies and they said oh the big rallies will never work in new hampshire you have to sit down and have dinner with everybody i said that like that a lot of dinners they dont expect thatbut you remember when we met and id have a lot of small meetings too with people wed talk and new hampshire more than any other place taught me about drugs flowing into this country and your police department so great the police departments in new hampshire they told me i went to some i became friendly with some and i never knew i never knew honestly i knew it was bad i never knew it was so bad and i said to the people of new hampshire because more than any other place you look at the beautiful little roadways and lakes and streams and everything is so beautiful the trees and you say how could they have a drug problem here it doesnt fitbut id sit down with groups and i said what your biggest problem and i figured theyd say maybe the veterans which are suffering greatly in this area we understand that but it was always  and well solve that problem but it was always you know what it was always heroine id say heroine what do you mean and i learned so much and i said to the people of new hampshire that if i win which i did with new hampshire if i win and i also said and if i go all the way we are going to stop the inflow of drugs into new hampshire and into our country 100 percent and i gave the people of new hampshire my pledge more than anybody else in this case because they really taught me about what happening with the world of drugs pouring in hard to believe it just so so strange when you look and see the beauty of this place and then you see that heroin and drugs are your number one problem by faranyway with months these lobbyists sealed over 26 billion in foreign arms deals including over 19 billion in qatar some people would say qatar which happened to be off bill clinton 1 million as a birthday gift for a few minutes of face time 1 million the lobbyists one of whom was the sisterinlaw to hillary clinton current campaign chairman received hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees the contractor got billions of dollars in contracts and hillary clinton got her campaign cash and money for her foundationand you know im putting up tremendous amounts of money today i wrote another check for 10 million im spending money like crazy ill probably have over maybe close to or over 100 million of my money spent on the campaign but there something nice about that unless i lose in which case i say what was that all about but were gonna do what right for you not what right for some contributor or special interest hillary put the office of the secretary of state up for sale and if she ever got the chance believe me she would put the office and you know what office im talking about the office called the oval office up for sale too i propose a contract with the american voter which will end corruption and give government back to our great people i want the entire corrupt washington establishment to hear and heed the words im about to say and i never loved this expression but now i love it because it become it become the hottest expression if we win on november 8th we are going to washington dc when we win ok and we are going to drain the swamp at the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs youve been suffering with the jobs the jobs have gone like candy being taken from a baby new growth numbers just released put the average growth rate for this year at a disastrous 15 percent if china goes down to 7 or 8 percent gdp you know it like a national catastrophe last quarter we were at 1 percent our job numbers last week were horrible they were anemic as the expression goes they like to say anemic that was the word they used obama is the first president in modern history not to have a single year of 3 percent growthand they say it hard because were a large county well india is a much larger country and theyre at 8 percent china is at 7 percent and china not happy so were at around 1 percent and we just keep going along just keep going along losing our jobs to mexico and every other place fortyseven million americans are on food stamps and 45 million people think of it this is our country are living in povertymeanwhile our trade deficit with the world is now nearly 800 billion a year you say who negotiates these contracts were living through obama it true you know instead of campaigning for hillary clinton he ought to be in the white house in the oval office negotiating trade deals beating isis taking care of our veterans which he does not do were living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world theyre stealing our jobs greatest in the history of the worldnew hampshire has lost one in three manufacturing jobs since nafta a deal signed by bill clinton and supported strongly by hillary weve lost 70000 factories since china entered the world trade organization another bill and hillary disasterthe trump administration will immediately begin negotiating and we will start this negotiation so fast we will start a negotiation on nafta and if we dont get the deal we want we will terminate nafta and get a much much better trade deal and i wont go into the details but because theyre different tax systems theyre under a vat system and were under our system but because of the fact that theyre under a much different tax system the day the deal was signed it was a defective deal with us having a massive at least 17 percent disadvantageso it complicated im not going to bother you or bore you with it but weve been working with a defective deal for years and nobody no politician ever went back to renegotiate it were going to get it done folks so easily if a company wants to fire their workers and go to mexico or another country and then they think theyre going to ship their products back into the united states we will charge them a tax of 35 percent so when you think these companies which right now are out there negotiating to leave here theyll leave new hampshire theyll leave pennsylvania theyre gonna leave ohio theyre gonna leave all of these places all of our great places and great states and right now as were talking theyre negotiating dealsmexico is the eighth wonder of the world in terms of the new plants a friend of mine bill plante he the biggest he said the eighth wonder of the world what happening in mexico and i say and i tell this to people what about us he said meh not gonna be it gonna be the other way around but there will be consequences and you know when they realize that theyve got to now pay a tax all of that to come through our very strong border because there will be a strong border  with their product you know what theyre gonna say theyre gonna say let say were not gonna move and theyre gonna stay it very simple but the politicians dont want to do that because theyre controlled theyre controlled by the people that give them their campaign contributions and probably other things we will does anybody know what i mean by that we will also stand up to chinese currency manipulation and we will stop the transpacific partnership we will become a rich nation again but to be a rich nation we must also be a safe nation hillary clinton unleashed isis onto the world and it has now spread into our country there are right now 1000 open isis investigations across the united states more than at any time that weve ever had now hillary wants to increase by 550 percent  the massive number of syrian refugees flowing into our country that over the obama numbers and those are thousands and thousands of people a trump administration will suspend the syrian refugee program and well help them will safe havens and well get other countries over there like the gulf states who have nothing but money we have 20 trillion in debt well get them to pay they gotta do their share well lead it well help theyll pay but you know what we cant let people into this country that we dont know about we dont know let me state this as clearly as i can if im elected president i am going to keep when we love new hampshire i love this place i love this place by the way you know were leading in florida were leading in all these places the recent poll said were two down in new hampshire you know what i said i dont think so i dont think so these polls these polls these are called dirty polls you know what that is these are false i dont think so she comes up here she has four people and it like oh we have a wonderful crowd i dont think so i think were winning new hampshire bigok so well change it when im elected president i am going to keep radical islamic terrorists the hell out of our country a trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the united states boy you people have energy youre great well let face it it been a long time right it been a long time youve been waiting a long time for the right person but you do have energyyou know what happening a lot of these placesa lot of the different places reports are coming out they hate to write it you know the dishonest media but people by the way great people oh theyre the worst theyre so dishonest they are so dishonest folks but a lot of these reports coming out in the early voting states people are coming up that have never voted these are great americans these are great people but theyve just never seen anybody that they wanted to like theyve never heard people say were going to actually bring back your jobs were not going to let companies leave us and fire everybody and move and then let the product pour into our country with no taxno no just go ahead leave fire all our people move to mexico make the product sell your air conditioners carrier an example theyre leaving they might not leave theyre probably all about ready to change their mind but just let your product come right in no tax no nothing i mean how stupid is this how stupidand im a freetrader im a fair trader but we have the wrong people represent us so what happening is these lines in florida are four blocks long they were never like that theyve never seen anything like it and in tennessee a great congressman been there for 25 years said to me ive never seen we have never seen anything like it people are coming out that havent voted in years people are coming out they literally they hadnt voted in years so theyre not polled because you know unless you voted like in the last election they dont want to poll you so people are coming out that hadnt voted in years happening in texas they havent voted in yearsand people that have never even voted and yet theyre great americans they just never saw somebody that they wanted to vote for and theyre coming out and theyve got the trump shirt and theyve got the hat theyve got buttons all over the place you know now who knows who knows they may have all of the trump stuff and you never know maybe theyre voting for crooked hillary clinton but i dont think so right i dont think so history has taught us that we dont think so so i think were doing greatand yes on the border we have no choice we will build a wall and mexico will pay for the wall got to stop the drugs got to stop the drugs remember my pledge to everybody but in particular to new hampshire because i know what youre going through with the drugs i know what your incredible law enforcement your police and your fire departments because i see where theyre helping so much believe me theyre theyre not spoken aboutand how about where theyre shooting during fires theyre shooting at the firemen now this is a new phenomenon theyre shooting at firemen theyre shooting bullets at firemen going to fires and fighting fires so we have a divided country and were going to make our country love again were going to bring it like this room countless americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this administration this includes incredible americans like 21yearold sarah root youve heard that story youve seen it youve read about itthe man who killed her arrived at the border entered federal custody and then was released into the united states community under the policies of this white house he was released again and again after crime after crime and now is at large sarah graduated from college just the day before with a 40 grade point average top in her class she was violently violently killed outstanding young woman i know her parents theyre incrediblealso among the victims of obamaclinton open borders policy was grant ronnebeck a 21yearold convenience store clerk in mesa arizona he was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary who had also been released from federal custody and so many people said please please please dont release him he violent and he shot grant through the headanother victim who weve all read about and known about kate steinle gunned down in the sanctuary city of san francisco by an illegal immigrant and this person was deported five previous times and now he got a good lawyer and the case will go on and on and on he got a lawyer i see them in court all the time the case will go on and on shot in the back while standing with her father great parents great brotherthen there is the case of 90yearold earl olander who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home the perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records a mile long but who did not meet the obama administration priorities for removal people begged that they be incarcerated or be moved out of the country but our geniuses wouldnt listenin california a 64yearold air force veteran marilyn pharis was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions but was never deported people asked please please deport him this is what happened this is a crime wave that never ends i can tell you it thousands of cases like thiswhen im president believe me it will end not only will a wall keep out the dangerous cartels and criminals but will also keep out the drugs remember new hampshire and the heroin poisoning our youth our youth is being poisoned before they get a chance and by the way ive met plenty of people in new hampshire that are not our youth that have a tremendous problem and i want to tell you were going to work with people were going to set up programs were going to try everything we can to get them unaddicted unaddicted so as i said when i won the new hampshire primary i promised the people of new hampshire that we would stop drugs from pouring into your community and i guarantee you we will you will be so proud of your president you will be so proud of your community you will be so proudi just want to say in closing i just want to say in closing that we have an amazing movement going on a movement like theyve never seen before a movement that hopefully wont be stopped we have a movement that the biggest people in the world of the media the biggest have said theyve never seen anything like it before every every crowd every auditoriumthe other night we had a situation we had thousands and thousands of people and i said to the fire marshal isnt it possible to let more in we had thousands of people in this massive field and we had many thousands outside of the gates they wouldnt let in and i said couldnt we let them in and they said we cant i said but there no fire were outside he said it stampede mr trump were worried about a stampedeand it a stampede of love it true it not a stampede it a stampede of love because there was so many people they said we have very

isis were getting rid of isis isis is we have no choice by the way not since medieval times has anyone seen chopping off of heads drowning in steel cages burying in sand not since not since medieval times it all grew during the tenure of obama and hillary clintonisis you know she stands up and she says what she gonna do well she was there it came out of the vacuum because we should have never gone into iraq but once we did we should have gone out the right way not the wrong way and the way they went out was so bad so bad including giving back mosul which now theyre fighting to take back and it would have been nice the element of surprise do we agree does anybody not agree the element of surprise we dont use the element of surprise we use the element of tell them everything we can possibly tell them give them plenty of time to get ready and then attack and it turns out to be a lot tougher than they ever thoughtbut were going to have a country that youre going to be proud of again were going to have a president that hopefully you will be proud of i will work so hard for every community ill be working very hard for the africanamerican community for the hispanic community

thank you very much in six days we are going to win the great state of florida and we are going to win back the white house 100 percent were on the cusp of an incredible historic change that transfers power from a failed political establishment and returns that power to our families communities and citizens to youthe system is rigged remember that the system is rigged right now it rigged were going to change itthere some breaking news about that subject that were going to discuss right now as i mentioned yesterday on of theand you probably saw this and maybe some of you have just read itone of the top department of justice officials involved in the email investigation assistant attorney general peter kassig is a close associate of john podesta the two met for dinner after clinton testified about benghazi and podesta who by the way said hillary clinton has terrible instincts on wikileaks described him as the man who kept him podesta out of jailkadzik is also the one who helped lead the effort to confirm attorney general loretta lynch now today in a newly released e mailthrough wikileaks againwe learned that kadzik was feeding information about the investigation into the clinton campaign and that right and that kadzik said quote it will be a while before the state department posts the emails remember they were waiting for the emails podesta forwarded the emails to clinton top staff and said additional chances for mischief these are the people that want to run our country folks the spread of political agendas into the justice departmentthere never been a thing like this that has happened in our country historyis one of the saddest things that has happened to our country but with your vote you can beat the system the rigged system and deliver justice so show up early and vote show up early you know the lines are incredible the polls are all saying were going to win florida dont believe it dont believe it get out there and vote pretend were slightly behind you got to getwe dont want to blow thisthis is the one chance we have itll never happen again it not going to happen in four years it not going to happenit cant happen again this is a movement like we have never seen in this country before these crowds the enthusiasm the love got to get out and vote real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing obamacare and hillary is not going to be the answer because she wants to make it more expensive she doubling down it just been announced that the residents of floridasorry to tell you this folksare going to experience a massive massive double digit premium hike now i know what that hike is but i want you to leave here happy i want you to be happy people i want you to think about the future after we take back the white house so im not going to tell you what your hike is but let me just say it going to be very substantial and obamacare doesnt work on top of everything else as an example in the great state of arizonawhich i just leftpremiums are going up more than 116 percent it out of controlover 90 percent of the counties in florida are losing obamacare insurance next year lots of luck in your negotiation in minnesota where the premium increase will be close to 60 percent the democratic governor said the affordable care act is no longer affordable premiums are surging companies are leaving insurers are fleeing doctors are quitting and deductibles are absolutely through the roof wasnt supposed to be like this but i said it was going to be like this before it was passed because i understand how business worksobamacare never had a chance it a catastrophe yet hillary clinton wants to double down on obamacare making it even more expensive it going to go up a lot people arent going to be able to afford it so im not sure that it matters theyre just not going to be able to pay im asking for your vote so we can replace obamacare and save health care for every family in florida and the united states real change also means restoring honesty to our government as you know the fbi hasdid you hear about this little event the fbi reopening the investigation theyre reopening the investigation into crooked hillary clinton crooked hillary she crooked lock her up! lock her up! lock her up!she is a crooked one there no question crooked hillary clinton you know that term has really stuck everyone calling herhas anyone seen crooked hillary clinton today that going to be a great term for a president right boy oh boy what a mess this is the biggest scandal since watergate and now it been reported that there are fbi inquiries probing virtually all of hillary clinton inner circle and many of the things she done over the years it about time remember it a rigged system remember it about timeshe wants to blame everyone else for her mounting legal troubles but she really has no one to blame but herself hillary is the one who set up the illegal private email server to shield her criminal activity the woman screaming exactly exactly it is exactly hillary is the one who engaged in a corrupt payforplay scheme at the state department and who ripped off the people of haiti the people of haiti were ripped off and i met with the people of little haiti anybody herethese are great people great thank youhillary is the one who endangered national security by sending classified information on an insecure server hillary is the one who lied so many times to congress and the fbi hillary is the one who made 13 phones disappear some with a hammer and she the one who destroyed 33000 emails after receiving a congressional subpoena she also accepted debate questions given to her in advance by donna brazile and then used those debate questions to cheat it cheating the worst level instead of reporting this breach to an ethics committee or whoever would listen to the breach so she got the answers cheating she got the questions cheating and then sherather than reporting them rather than saying this shouldnt be happeningshe used them against bernie sanderscan you imagine she probably got them against me too except we won the debate so easy i dont think it mattered we won those debates did you see her at the end of the debates folks she was exhausted you know what she did she immediately went home and went to sleep hillary is not the victim and the american people frankly are the victims of this rigged and corrupt system in every way but this is your chance finally to change it november 8th now in florida case earlier now just so you understand record turnout unbelievable numbers unbelievable were doing great with the africanamerican community were doing great with the hispanic community and the lines are four five and six blocks long theyve never seen anything like it and the polls have just come up were way up in florida i shouldnt say that because i want you to go vote ok ready were going to pretend were down were down pretend right well pretend were down no we got to win we got to win big we got to beat her got to beat her were up in ohio were up in iowa were up in north carolina i think were doing great in pennsylvania from what i hear folks youre going to be so proud youre going to be so proud were going to make america great again youre going to be so happy and youre going to be so proud of your country againif hillary clinton were to be elected it would create an unprecedented and protracted constitutional crisis havent we just been through a lot with the clintons right remember when he was impeached for lying he cant practice law he doesnt have the right to practice law didnt we just go through this and the last thing we need is another four years of obama that the last thing and this will be worse that means isis that means high taxes that means bad health care that means no border without a border we dont have a country the work of government would grind to a halt if she were ever elected shell be in court for her entire tenure and shell be convicted because look the first timei mean frankly forget about this time the first time she gets a subpoena from the united states congress and she deletes everything there shouldnt have been a second timebut i have respect that the fbi has given it a second chance and this time i have no doubt that in that 650000 emailsdid you see where they said oh were not worried theyre duplicates how can there be duplicates if there are hundreds of thousands more than you started off with so today i guess wikileaks it sounds like is going to be dropping some more and if we met tomorrow ill tell you about it tomorrow but one beauty that been caught was and this was just recently newly released where they say having a dump were having a dump of all of those emailsin another communication bill clinton chief of staff says foreign governmentright this should be another one just like swampyou know the swamp little statementthis one this one do you remember what it is right all the money is in right they said all the money is in theyre talking about foreign money pouring into their pockets they said all the money is in this is what is running for office honestly she should be ashamed of herself she should be ashamed of herselfmy contract with the american voter begins with a plan to restore honesty to our government that includes a ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for american elections makes sense i want the entire corrupt washington establishment to hear and to heed the words we all will be saying right now when we win on november 8th we are going to washington dc and we are going to drain the swamp gonna drain the swamp were gonna drain the swamp folks were gonna drain that swamp another important issue for americans is integrity in journalism these people are among the most dishonest people ive ever met spoken to done business with these are the most dishonest people there has never been dishonestythere has never been dishonesty like weve seen in this election there never been anywhere near the media dishonesty like weve seen in this election dont worry they wont spin the cameras and show the kind of massive crowds they wont do that the very talented michael goodwin of the new york post just wrote today that 2016 presidential race will mark the lowwater mark of journalism that is worthythink of itof the first amendment never before have so many media organizations old and new abandoned all pretense of fairness to take sides and try to pick a president it unbelievable it unhonestfor instance we have a great story we give it out to the media theyll make it look as bad as possibleas bad as possible parentheticallyso sad parenthetically and very sadly earnings for the new york times are down 97 percent this year they just announced that so bad i feel so badly for them just announced97 percent oh theyre doing great and then they tell you who to vote for you know who to vote for they want crooked hillarythis isnt about me it about all of you and our magnificent movement to make america great again all over this country and theyre talking about it all over the worldat the core of my contract is my plan to bring back jobs right now 70 million american women and children live in poverty or near the brink of poverty fortythree percent of african american schoolaged children live in poverty thirtytwo

plan for revitalization we will replace decades of failure with generations of success florida has lost one in four of its manufacturing jobs since nafta a deal signed by bill clinton and supported by hillary and here a number that you should remember because it not even a believable number and it correct america has lost 70000 factories since china entered the world trade organization another bill

immediately stop the jobkilling trans pacific partnership a disaster and hillary wants it to happen she called it the gold standard then she rejected it but she going to approve it then she lied during the debate right she lied she lied during the debate she said she never called it the gold standard she lied and she lied about the line in the sand right she lied as part of our plan to bring back jobs were going to lower taxes on american business from 35 percent to 15 percent we will also cancel billions in global warming payments to the united nations and use that money to support america vital environmental infrastructure and natural resources were spending hundreds of billions of dollars we dont even know who doing what with the money were gonna spend the money here were gonna work on our own environment that includes repairing the herbert hoover dike at lake okeechobee and protecting the florida everglades we will become a rich nation again but to be a rich nation we must also be a safe nation a terrible tragedy today has occurred in iowa you read you saw early this morning two iowa police officers outstanding outstanding people were murdered ambushed ambushed violently while sitting in their squad cars we send our thoughts and prayers to the family of the fallen i just left iowa most beautiful place the treatment was so incredible the crowds the police officers were so incredible the job they did now two of them are dead an attack on our police is an attack on all of us law enforcement is the line separating civilization from total chaos you have to remember that according to the national law enforcement officers memorial fund firearm related police were up 48 percent this year the highest theyve ever been and there have been 14 ambush style attacks this year alone never had anything like thisand what it is is a lack of respect for our nation it a lack of respect for our leadership to all the great men and women of law enforcement i want you to know were with you we support you and we will stand by you we will restore law order and justice in americajustice thank you thank you so good luck to the people of iowawe will also work with our federal and local law enforcements to keep america safe from terrorism hillary clinton wants a 550 percent increase in syrian refugees pouring into our countries her plan would mean generations of terrorism and extremism spreading in your schools and all throughout your communities when im president we will suspend the syrian refugee programand we will keep radical islamic terrorist the hell out of your community now we all have heart and were gonna build safe zones and were gonna have some of the gulf states that have nothing but money theyll put up the money well lead it well build safe zonesbut we have enough problems in our country she wants to increase the thousands and thousands that are pouring in right now she wants to increase that number by 550 percentand then you wonder why podesta says she has bad instincts and you wonder why bernie sanders says she got bad judgment theyre right she got bad judgment personally i think she a very unstable person if you wanna really know the truth and were gonna repeal and replace obamacare but you wanna know something honestly i think for herself she got much bigger problems right now than obamacare she got bigger problems let see what on all those emails that they just found see what on those emailsthank youit too bad those cameras arent turning around to see this incredible group of people with thousands more outside isnt it too bad they dont do it but you know if hillary speaks and there 30 people in the line they say the crowd is massive she never had a crowd like this in her life president obama shouldnt be campaigning for any longer it really a conflict right he oughta be working on jobs on the border on building up our military instead of campaigning for crooked hillary clinton is what he oughta be doing he in north carolina but were going to north carolina right after this so but we have a few more today in florida and we have massive crowds there something happening theyre not reporting it katie youre not reporting it katie but there something happening katie there something happening katie a trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the united states and yes we will build the wall thank you weve received the first ever endorsement from our ice and border patrol officers first time theyve ever endorsed a presidential candidate they tell us the border crisis taking place right now is the worst it ever been now in all fairness people probably figure that im going to win so theyre racing across the border i dont know im sorry to do this to you folks hillary has pledged totally open borders meaning you dont have a country anymore and she strongly supports sanctuary cities like in san francisco whereright where kate steinle was killed by a five time deported illegal immigrant the immigration officers warn that hillary plan is the most radical immigration proposal in us history and that it will lead to the loss of thousands of lives and i believe that as secretary of state hillary clinton allowed thousands of the most dangerous and violent criminal aliens to go free because their countries would not take them back countless innocent americans have been killed by illegal immigrants last year as an example 17yearold starlett pitts her boyfriend and her mother were stabbed to death in their lee high acres home by an illegal immigrant the killer had been convicted of assaulting a police officer and was wanted for double murder and robbery and the people that knew him were begging that he be incarcerated they were begging he was released from custody pending his court appearance enabling him to commit murdera trump administration will stop illegal immigration deport all criminal aliens and save american lives and i want to thank by the way i see all these signscubans for trump cubans i love cubans so they gave me last week the bay of pigs association right you know they gave me their award last week and it was a great honor and were gonna fight very hard for the cubans and were gonna fight very very hard for the hispanics because they have not been properly taken care ofwhat happened with the hispanic population in our country is not

second amendment which is under siege and appoint justices to the united states supreme court who will uphold and defend the constitution of the united states clinton wants us to think small wants us

hardworking american patriots who love your family and love your countryclinton campaign relies on the tired tactic of smearing opponents who question her policies as racists it the oldest play in the democratic play book  and americans have had enoughthey want solutions and they want better lives  not more petty attacks from failed and discredited politicianspeople who want their immigration laws enforced and their borders secured are not racists they are patriotic americans of all backgrounds who want their jobs and families protectedpeople who warn about radical islamic terrorism are not islamophobes they are decent american citizens who want to uphold our tolerant values and keep our country safepeople who support the police and who want crime reduced are not prejudiced they are concerned and loving citizens whose hearts break every time an innocent child is lost to preventable violenceyet while she lives behind gates and walls and guards and raises millions from hedge fund managers and wall street donors she slanders and smears working people who just want a fraction of the security enjoyed by our politiciansher comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as secretary of state hide and delete her emails destroy her phones with a hammer put classified information in the reach of our enemies lie to congress and sell government favors and access through the clinton foundationit the same attitude of arrogance and entitlement that explains why she has never taken accountability for the disasters she created

home i am running to reverse these failures and create a new american futurethat future begins with prosperity at homemy economic agenda can be summed up in three words jobs jobs jobsone of my highest priorities is to bring jobs into our inner cities africanamericans communities have suffered horribly as a result of failed democratic leadershipdemocrats have run these inner cities for half a

africanamerican children under the age of 6 now live in poverty more than 3000 have been shot in chicago this year alone 58 of africanamerican youth are not workingthese are the results of the policies embraced by hillary clinton and everyone knows that if she elected the inner cities will get nothing but more pain and more sufferinghillary clinton has been there in washington for 30 years

already get your absentee ballot so make sure to start votingyesterday i outlined my contract with the american voter  a detailed list of solutions to bring prosperity to our economy safety to our communities and honesty to our governmentone of the issues i addressed at length is the issue of government corruption i put forward a plan to stop it my opponent has no plan to end government corruption because she is the embodiment of government corruption even as she was preparing to run for president wikileaks emails show hillary was trying to get 12 million from the king of morocco in yet one more payforplay schememy goal is to keep foreign money out of american politics hillary clinton goal is to put the oval office up for sale to whatever country offers the highest priceso i have a message today to the voters of america it a message for republicans democrats and independents it a message for those living in rural america urban america and suburban america  because we are all just one americait a message for everyone who wants to take back our government from the special interestsand my message is this if we win on november 8th we are going to fix our rigged system and we are going to drain the swamp of corruption in washington dcthat change includes a new foreign policy that puts america firsthillary clinton foreign policy has squandered trillions in american wealth overseas yet for all the money spent all clinton delivered was death destruction and terrorism she unleashed isis and turmoil in iraq syria and libyanext triggerhappy hillary wants to start a shooting war in syria that could involve nucleararmed russia  she has bad judgment bad instincts and is just too reckless to be allowed into the oval officehillary also started the negotiations that led to the iran deal  and thus ultimately leading to the 17 billion ransom for american hostagesclinton gave iran everything they wanted and more  including iraq now iran is emboldened as never beforein the latest insult to america the government of iran is demanding many billions in new ransom payments for an american businessman and his ailing father adding to the insult iran has released a video of their captive that includes footage from earlier this year of american soldiers being forced to their knees at gunpointthe humiliation for our country never seems to end  and it the humiliation brought on by a secretary of state who was more interested in getting paid by foreign countries than in representing the country she lives into coverup her crimes as secretary of state hillary clinton bleached and deleted 33000 emails lied to congress under oath made 13 phones disappear  some with a hammer  and then told the fbi she couldnt remember 39 timesthe best evidence that the system is rigged is that hillary clinton is even allowed to run for president in the first placethe clintons grew their gross income by 60 million while hillary was secretary of state she not a diplomat  she a grifter always looking for an easy way to sell government favors and access in exchange for cashthe clintons end up with the money and america ends up with the humiliationwhen i am president america will be respected in the world once againthat also means standing up against the oppression of the castro regime in cuba and standing in solidarity with freedomloving people in venezuela and across

five people who were granted criminal immunity will ever be allowed to serve in a clinton administrationand here is the demand i am making today to president obama will you pledge here and now not to issue a pardon to hillary clinton and her coconspirators for their many crimes against our country and society itselfno one is above the law not even hillary clintonclinton and her cronies will say anything do anything lie about anything to keep their grip onpower  to keep their control over this countryremember the clinton pardon of fugitive marc rich in exchange for unknown and undisclosed amounts of moneythe american people have had it with years decades of clinton corruption and scandals they are tired of the lies they are tired of the trivial politics they are tired of being talked down to looked down upon and treated like second class citizensthis will be the year the american people say enough is enoughhillary clinton has been a disaster for so many communities but especially for africanamerican communities i dont think africanamericans are going to come out and vote for clinton  they are too smart and they know they are being used they also know that shell do nothing for them once the election is over  she never does and that will never change many of them will never forget her calling young africanamerican men superpredatorsto the africanamerican community let me ask you this question are you better off than you were eight years ago if not vote for donald trump i will bring jobs great education and safe neighborhoodsif you keep voting for the same people you will keep getting the same resultslook at what the democrats have done to detroit half of detroit residents do not work nearly 40 of the city lives in poverty it the second most dangerous city in america according to the fbithis is the legacy of the policies embraced by hillary clintona trump administration will bring prosperity to all of our peoplemy economic agenda can be summed up with three very beautiful words jobs jobs jobswe are going to pass the biggest tax cut since ronald reaganevery wasteful and unnecessary regulation will be eliminatedwe will unleash the power of american energythe catastrophe known as obamacare will be repealed and replacedand the disastrous trade deals like nafta that have caused so much pain in michigan will be renegotiated  and we will bring back your automanufacturingmichigan has lost more than 1 in 3 of its manufacturing jobs since the twin disasters of nafta and china entrance into the wto  both deals pushed by bill clinton and supported by hillary clintonbefore nafta went into effect there were 280000 auto workers in michigan today that number is only 160000ford is moving its small car production to mexicoit used to be that the cars were made in flint and you couldnt drink the water in mexico today the cars are made in mexico and you cant drink the water in flinthillary clinton also gave us the jobkilling trade deal with south korea which has cost this country another 100000 jobshillary opposed the korea deal when she was running for president in 2007 she campaigned right here in michigan and said the korea deal will hurt the us auto industry increase our trade deficit cost us good middleclass jobs and make america less competitive she pledged to reject the dealbut she lied to all of you just like she lied about her emailsonce installed as secretary of state she supported it and called it a cuttingedge deal she rammed it through to adoption  she always does whatever the donors tell her to do no matter how it impacts our families schools and communitiesthe us trade deficit with korea in the top ten products that michigan exports to korea grew 54 percent as exports fell and imports rose this is what hillary clinton did to your stateaccording to the economic policy institute michigan ranks first for jobs lost as a share of workforce due to the trade deficit with tpp members and the country lost 740000 manufacturing jobs as a result of that deficit last year just imagine how many more automobile jobs will be lost if the tpp is actually approved as hillary clinton is planning to dohillary clinton is merely a vessel for the special interests trying to strip this country of its wealth its jobs and its status as a sovereign nationshe even supports the disastrous surrender of america control of the internet which is happening tomorrow hillary clinton website says she supports the decision to give away the internet to a global community of stakeholderssomeone needs to inform hillary clinton it not the job of our leaders to represent a global community it the job of our leaders to represent american citizens losing control of the internet to other foreign entities is just one more way obamaclinton have sold out the citizens of this countryhillary clinton is a globalist who will never protect the freedom and jobs of the american peoplei am not running to be president of the world i am running to be president of the united states of americahave you ever wondered why it is that all the things that the american people want never seem to happenthe reason for this is simple it because the financial interests who control our politics and our media dont want these changes to happenhillary clinton has been there for 30 years and has never done anything for you and yourfamilyjust look at how badly she messed up on the iran deal and just today we learned that on the same day as the hostages were released the united states signed an agreement lifting sanctions on two iranian banks involved in financing iran missile programshillary clinton is there for only one reason to protect her donors and collect their moneyour campaign is taking on big business big media and big donors  were taking them on for you so you can have the future you wantour campaign is about breakingup the special interest monopoly in washington dc were trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors the large corporations and the media executivestheyre all part of the same corrupt political establishment and they nod along when hillary clinton slanders you as deplorable

45,thank you for the opportunity to speak with youtoday im going to outline a plan for american economic revival  it is a bold ambitious forwardlooking plan to massively increase jobs wages incomes and opportunities for the people of our countrymy plan will embrace the truth that people flourish under a minimum government burden and it will tap into the incredible unrealized potential of our workers and their dreamsright now 92 million americans are on the sidelines outside the workforce and not part of our economy it a silent nation of jobless americanslook no further than the city of flint where i just visited the jobs have stripped from this community and its infrastructure has collapsed in 1970 there were more than 80000 people in flint working for gm  today it is less than 8000 now ford has announced it is moving all small car production to mexicoit used to be cars were made in flint and you couldnt drink the water in mexico now the cars are made in mexico and you cant drink the water in flintwe are going to turn this aroundmy economic plan rejects the cynicism that says our labor force will keep declining that our jobs will keep leaving and that our economy can never grow as it did once beforewe reject the pessimism that says our standard of living can no longer rise and that all that left to do is divide up and redistribute our shrinking resourceseverything that is broken today can be fixed and every failure can be turned into a great successjobs can stop leaving our country and start pouring in failing schools can become flourishing schools crumbling roads and bridges can become gleaming new infrastructure inner cities can experience a flood of new jobs and investment and rising crime can give way to safe and prosperous communitiesall of these things and so much more are possible but to accomplish them we must replace the present policy of globalism  which has moved so many jobs and so much wealth out of our country  and replace it with a new policy of americanismunder this american system every policy decision we make must pass a simple test does it create more jobs and better wages for americansif we lower our taxes remove destructive regulations unleash the vast treasure of american energy and negotiate trade deals that put america first then there is no limit to the number of jobs we can create and the amount of prosperity we can unleashamerica will truly be the greatest place in the world to invest hire grow and to create new jobs new technologies and entire new industriesinstead of driving jobs and wealth away america will become the world great magnet for innovation and job creationmy opponent plan rejects this optimism she offers only more taxing regulating more spending and more wealth redistribution  a future of slow growth declining incomes and dwindling prosperitythe only people who get rich under hillary clinton scheme are the donors and the special interestsin hillary clinton america we have surrendered our status as the world great economy and we have surrendered our middle class to the whims of foreign countriesnot one single idea she has will create one net american job or create one new dollar of american wealth for our workers the only thing she can ever offer is a welfare check our plan will produce paychecks and theyre going to be great paychecks for millions of people now unemployedin the course of this campaign i have travelled all across this country and ive met the most amazing people every day ive seen the goodness and character of our country and brave citizens proudly fighting through hard times and difficult circumstancesin many parts of our country the hard times never seem to end ive visited cities and towns in upstate new york where half the jobs have left and moved to other countriespoliticians have abandoned these places all over our country and the people who live thereworse still politicians have heaped scorn and disdain on these wonderful americans my opponent described tens of millions of american citizens as deplorable and irredeemable  how can hillary clinton seek to lead this country when she considers its citizens beyond redemptionthe hardworking people she calls deplorable are the most admirable people i know they are cops and soldiers teachers and firefighters young and old moms and dads blacks whites and latinos  but above everything else they are all american they love their families they love their country and they want a better futurethese are the forgotten men and women of america people who work hard but dont have a voicei am running to be their voice and to fight to bring prosperity to every part of this countrytoo many of our leaders have forgotten that it their duty to protect the jobs wages and wellbeing of american workers before any other considerationim not running to be president of the world im running to be president of the united states  and as your president i will fight for every last american jobwe are the nation that tamed the west dug out the panama canal won two world wars and put a man on the moonit time to start thinking big once againthat why i believe it is time to establish a national goal of reaching 4 economic growthin working with my economic team weve put together a plan that puts us on track to achieve that goal over the next ten years our economic team estimates that under our plan the economy will average 35 growth and create a total of 25 million new jobs you can visit our website to see the maththis growth means that our jobs plan including our childcare reforms will be completely paidfor in combination with proposed budget savingsit will be deficit neutral if we reach 4 growth it will reduce the deficitit will be accomplished through a complete overhaul of our tax regulatory energy and trade policiesright now under obamaclinton policies the economy grew only 11 percent last quarter  that translates to millions of lost jobsthis is the weakest socalled recovery since the great depressionover the last 7 years the economy grew only 21 percent the slowest period in seventy years had the economy grown under obama at the same rate as reagan it would have meant 10 million more jobsperhaps most shockingly 1 in 6 men aged 1834 are either in jail or out of workmeanwhile another 2 million hispanicamericans have been added to the ranks of those in povertyon top of it all the obamaclinton policies have doubled the national debt it took more than 230 years for the united states to accumulate it first 10 trillion dollars in debt  it took president obama only eight years to add another 10 trillionnow it would be one thing if that money had been used to completely rebuild our nation our military and our infrastructureinstead the opposite happened we doubled our debt and in return we have dilapidated infrastructure failing schools a badly depleted military and another 14 million people who have left the workforcenever has so much money been spent so poorlybut were going to turn that all around here howit begins with bold new tax reformas outlined in detroit our tax plan will greatly simplify the code and reduce the number of brackets from 7 to 3 the 3 new brackets will be 12 25 and 33 but lowincome americans will pay no income tax at all  in fact our plan will remove millions and millions of workers from the income tax rolls entirelyby lowering rates streamlining deductions and simplifying the process we will add millions of new jobsin addition because we have strongly capped deductions for the wealthy and closed special interest loopholes the tax relief will be concentrated on the working and middle class taxpayer they will receive the biggest benefit  it wont even be closethis is a working and middle class tax relief proposalthe tax relief for these workers will be expanded by my childcare proposals that i have worked on with my daughter ivankathese proposals are a central element of our comprehensive tax reform and economic growth planfamilies will be able to fully deduct the average cost of childcare from their taxes including stayathome parents because this deduction is capped it will disproportionately benefit working and middle class families the less you make the larger a share of your income you can exclude from taxationparents will also be able to enroll in taxfree dependent care savings accounts for their children or elderly relatives lowincome households will benefit from both an expanded earned income tax credit  in the form a childcare rebate  and a matching 500 contribution for their savings accountsa married couple earning 50000 per year with two children and 8000 in child care expenses will save 35 from their current tax billa married couple earning 75000 per year with two children and 10000 in child care expenses will receive a 30 reduction in their tax billby contrast someone earning 5 million will receive virtually no change in their tax bill at allone of our greatest job creation measures is going to be our 15 business tax rate  down from the current 35 rate a reduction of more than 40 percent an explosion of new business and new jobs will be created it will be amazing to watchwe will also allow usbased manufacturers to fully expense the cost of new plants and equipmenton top of that we will bring back trillions in business wealth parked overseas and tax it at a 10 rate some people say there are 2 trillion dollars overseas i think it 5 trillion by taxing it at 10 instead of 35 all of this money will come back into our countrywe will turn america into a magnet for new jobs  and that means jobs in our poorest communitiesnext comes regulationsone of the keys to unlocking growth is scalingback years of disastrous regulations unilaterally imposed by our outofcontrol bureaucracyregulations have grown into a massive jobkilling industry  and the regulation industry is one business i will put an end toin 2015 alone federal agencies issued over 3300 final rules and regulations up from 2400 the prior year every year overregulation costs our economy 2 trillion dollars a year and reduces household wealth by almost 15000 dollarsive proposed a moratorium on new federal regulations that are not compelled by congress or public safety and i will eliminate all needless and jobkilling regulations now on the booksthis includes eliminating some of our most intrusive regulations like the waters of the us rule it also means scrapping the epa socalled clean power plan which the government itself estimates will cost 72 billion a year this obamaclinton directive will shut down most if not all coalpowered electricity plans in america remember what hillary clinton said she wants to shut down the miners just like she wants to shut down the steel millswere going to put our great miners and steel workers back to workenergy reform is central to our plan as wellaccording to the heritage foundation by 2030 president obama energy restrictions will eliminate another half a million manufacturing jobs reduce economic output by 25 trillion dollars and reduce incomes by 7000 dollars per personhillary clinton wants to go even further and her plan could cost the economy 5 trillion dollarsa trump administration will lift restrictions on all sources of american energy production according to the institute for american energy resources this willincrease gdp by more than 100 billion annuallyadd over 500000 new jobs annuallyincrease annual wages by more than 30 billion over the next 7 yearsincrease federal state and local tax revenues by almost 6 trillion over 4 decadesincrease total economic activity by more than 20 trillion over the next 40 yearsin addition we will streamline the permitting process for all energy infrastructure projects including the billions of dollars in projects held up by president obama  creating countless more jobs in the processfinally comes trade  the foundation for everythingamerica annual trade deficit with the world is now nearly 800 a billion a year  an enormous drag on growthbetween world war ii and the year 2000 the united states averaged a 35 growth rate but after china joined the world trade organization our average growth rate has been reduced to only 2 percentpredatory trade practices product dumping currency manipulation and intellectual property theft have taken millions of jobs and trillions in wealth from our countryit is no great secret that many of the special interests funding my opponent campaign are the same people profiting from these terrible trade deals the same socalled experts advising hillary clinton are the same people who gave us nafta china entry into the world trade organization the jobkilling trade deal with south korea and now the transpacific partnershipthe verdict is in all of the special interests that the media race to for comment have been proven wrong about every single deal theyve promoted  every lie and every prediction has crashed upon the rocks of realityour manufacturing base has crumbled communities have been hollowed out wages have declined and households are making less today than they were in the year 2000i have proposed a detailed plan to reform our trade policies and bring vast new jobs and wealth to america this includes the following stepsim going to direct the secretary of commerce to identify every violation of trade agreements a foreign country is currently using to harm our workers i will use every tool under american and international law to end these abuses and i will use our greatest business leaders and finest negotiators  and i know who you are many of you are in the roomwe are going to start with nafta which is causing so much damage to our country we will entirely renegotiate nafta into a deal that will either be good for us or will be terminated until a brand new and productive deal can be signedwe are also going to keep america out of the transpacific partnershipnext i am going to instruct my treasury secretary to label china a currency manipulator and to apply tariffs to any country that devalues its currency to gain an unfair advantage over the united statesi am going to instruct the us trade representative to bring trade cases against china china unfair subsidy behavior is prohibited by the terms of its entrance to the wto and i intend to enforce those rulesif china does not stop its illegal activities including its theft of american trade secrets and intellectual property i will apply countervailing duties until china ceases and desistsjust the single action of enforcing intellectual property rules alone would add millions of new american jobs according to the us international trade commission improved protection of america intellectual property in china would add 2 million jobs a year to the united states every single yearwe are going to stop the outflow of jobs from our country and open a new highway of jobs back into our countryhere is how the plan adds upwe are proposing a 44 trillion tax cut that will score as 26 trillion under a dynamic growth model which is how taxes should be scored this includes the childcare planour economic team has further modeled that the growthinduced savings from trade energy and regulation reform will shave at least another 18 trillion off of the remaining costthat leaves around 800 billion dollars this money can all be saved through simple common sense reforms if we save just one penny of each federal dollar spent on nondefense and nonentitlement programs we can save almost 1 trillion over the next decade  again this is spending that does not touch defense and that does not touch entitlementsif our plan exceeds the 35 tenyear growth average then our jobs proposal will actually reduce the deficit savings will be compounded by the fact that people who are currently receiving unemployment or welfare will finally be able to find jobsthis is the most progrowth projobs profamily plan put forth perhaps in the history of our countrythis is what our new future will look likei am going to lower you taxes i am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations on business and in your life im going to unleash american energy im going to repeal and replace obamacare im going to appoint justices to the supreme court who will follow the constitution im going rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets im going to save your 2nd amendment im going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country and yes we will build the wall  and im going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals especially nafta  and we will only make great trade deals that put the american worker firstand we are going to put our miners and our steelworkers back to workwe will rebuild our roads bridges tunnels highways airports schools and hospitalsamerican cars will travel the roads american planes will soar in the skies and american ships will patrol the seasamerican steel will send new skyscrapers into the cloudsamerican hands will rebuild this nation  and american energy harvested from american sources will power this nation american workers will be hired to do the jobwe will put new american metal into the spine of this countryjobs will return incomes will rise and new factories will come rushing back to our shoreswe will make america wealthy againwe will make america strong againand will make america great againthank you and god bless!

documents have you been seeing this what going on released by wikileaks make more clear than ever just how much is at stake in november and how unattractive and dishonest our country has becomethe election of hillary clinton would lead in my opinion to the almost total destruction of our country as we know it she would be the most dishonest and the most corrupt person ever elected to high office and i dont think it would be closethe wikileaks emails show the department of justice fed information did you see this to the clinton campaignso think of this the department of justice you remember that whole deal with wild bill getting on the back of an airplane just happened to be in arizonahe was gonna play golf it was 110 degreesbut he gets on the back of the airplane to meet with the attorney general to talk about his golf game and to talk about his grandkids he was there for 39 minutes i think most of us know what happened so fed information department of justice fed information think of this to the clinton campaign about the email investigation so that the campaign could be prepared to cover up her crimes now did you ever hear did you ever hear anything like this and and by the way these dishonest people mainstream media they dont talk about this they dont talk about this now if i sneeze if donald trump sneezes today it a major story here you have department of justice coming to see them to brief them prior to their interview folks this is out of controland the fbi unbelievable people you have incredible people in the fbi i would be willing to be that they are so ashamed of what happened at the upper leveli would be willing to bet that they dont even sleep at nightthese are great people these are great americans and they cant believe what going onthis corruption and collision is just one more reason why i will ask my attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor our country has never been so low in addition to a special prosecutor to look into what happened and all of the corruption and all of the well say so called crimebut look when somebody deletes 33000 emails after getting a subpoena but we have to also remember this remember this this is maybe in a sense even more importantwe have to investigate the investigation we have to investigate the investigation weve never had a case like this and even congress you know is sort of theyve never had this before because there no event like this that ever took placenormally congress you know she lied to congress she lied to the fbi and remember he said she was negligent she was all the things you needed to be but she lied to congress she lied to the fbi she lied to everybody she even lied in the debates about the gold standard rightremember she said i never said gold standard and remember when i said line in the sand she said i wasnt secretary of state i said i think you were but let see even the press said she was secretary of state so she lied about thatbut think of this think of this there never been a time like this in our country and congress in all fairness and im so disappointed in them i am so disappointed in congress i am so disappointed and i mean both sides im not talking republican dem im talking everybody to allow a thing like this to go this is crime at the highest level she shouldnt be allowed to run for president you know that other people lives have been ruined destroyed for doing a tiny fraction of what she did you saw the man with the book he had to give back all the royalties and went through hell you saw the man with the picture of the submarine his mother goes around she devastated devastated took pictures of a submarine and you take a look at thisso we have to investigate the investigation and congress but i speak to congressmen they dont know what to do because normally they vote and they hand it over to the fbi and the justice department but the fbi and the justice department wont do anything so they dont know what to do now they do make laws maybe they have to make up a law for a case like this but they take these criminal acts in my opinion criminal acts hand them over to the fbi the fbi actually acknowledge that even frankly could have gone that speech could have been 10 times longerbut all of these things yes she did this yes she did this yes she did that yes she did that but were not going to do anything right but what do you do when you hand them over to the fbi and the justice department and that the end of it we have never been in a position like thisim so embarrassed by what taken place and im very very disappointed in congress because our people our politicians i dont know do they make a deal where everybody protects each other in washington maybe that it i really believe it i really believe it i almost say listen were going to leave you alone but when it our turn you have to leave them alone do they make deals like thisthis is the most heinous the most serious thing that ive ever seen involving justice in the united states in the history of the united states we have a person that has committed crimes that is now running for the presidency and she has the justice department where she essentially told the ag in the speech or a talk that shed appoint her ag again and this is the person that supposed to be rulingfolks whether i win lose or draw im ashamed of what happened to our country and so are you hillary clinton bleached and deleted 33000 emails and did you see two days ago boxes of emails and other things were missing they were missingso she deleted 33000 emails and bleached them by the way nobody bleaches nobody i have people that are sophisticated in this world they never even heard of it they called it acid wash meaning you can never retrieve them although i have a feeling that the nsa has them they dont want them they dont want to get them i have a feeling so then she did this after not before before would be bad she did this after getting a congressional subpoenanow if your friend is suing you in a regular lawsuit and you do that you go to jail here the united states congress subpoenas her emails and other things and she deletes the emails saying there are 33000 emails remember for the wedding and for yoga classes 33000 emails and then and then after all of that now theyre missing two boxes of perhaps the most important of the groupand what about her law firm you know what she using a phenomenal law firm i know the firm phenomenal law firm theyre the ones that did all this stuff remember they said we made a ruling they were workrelated you cant do that if theyre work related what you do is you show them you show them and you get them it a law firm nobody ever mentions the law firm is unbelievable it very powerful okobviously theyve done a great job but that law firm should be implicated in this crime ok theyre the ones they got rid of all this stuff the law firm got rid of all this stuff and they should be implicated because they have committed a crime they are not supposed to say oh we got rid of most of it that law firm that i know very well as i said total professionals total insiders they got rid of 33000 and much more than that it is one of the great miscarriages of justiceso then she destroyed her phones some with a hammer to cover up her crimes now how many of you people have gotten rid of cell phones and you start whacking them with a hammer has any please raise your hand please one what business are you ini see two hands we have 15000 two hands anybody else it is so disgraceful it so embarrassing and by the way were going to go over some of the wikileaks stuff the press hardly reports it they hardly report it she did a big number of catholics horrible number on catholics she did a horrible number on evangelicals through her peopleand they hardly report it while she was secretary of state she lost or disappeared almost 6 billion does anyone know that no how do you lose 6 billion even chelsea clinton in the wikileaks emails expressed quote serious concerns about conflicts of interest at the clinton foundation and the state departmentamericans have had it with the years and decades of clinton corruption it corruption whitewater cattle never is with these people remember years ago most of you are too young to remember remember the cattle she bought some cattle and she had the greatest return like almost in the history of cattle deals and some of these professional cattlemen and cattle women they say boy she really good at this stuff theyd been doing it all their lives they had never had a return like that it corruption folks it corruptionthey understood that by the way theyre smart they got it very quicklythis will finally be the year the american people say enough is enough during a recent trip to florida i had a chance to spend some time with the incredible residents of little haiti and you see what going on in haiti it a horrible thing and you see what going on with clinton it a horrible thing these are not fans of clinton that i can tell youthey despise the clintons for what they did to the haitian people new emails revealed by abc news just yesterday show that during the deadly earthquake in haiti which killed over 150000 people the clintons couldnt stop cashing in they kept cashing inas people were dying in haiti clinton insiders were separating out requests from friends of bill or william jefferson clinton vips so that their business interests or contracts would receive very special treatment while those who were not special friends would be put permanently on the sidelinesand remember this hillary brother running a gold mine put on the gold tony you saw tony tony anybody want to hire tony he put on the board of a big gold mine company having to do with haiti it so badlook were in a rigged system folks this is a rigged rigged system you saw so many of the things ill tell you this wikileaks stuff is unbelievable it tells you the inner heart you got to read it and you got to maybe get it because theyre not putting it out they want to put it out but they cant do that because without the media and without the press hillary clinton would be nothing shed be nothing zero and by the way did everybody see the debate the other day yes so they had nine online polls some of them had us 90 to 10 80 to 20 time magazine had like a massive look time magazine is no friend of mine except they put me on the cover so much not because they like me because they like selling magazinesbut time magazine it was total destruction and then the next morning she walks in and says did everybody see the debate people go yes yes did we beat her or what i look so forwardi do i look so forward to the next one in las vegasas haiti death toll from hurricane matthew is on the rise we should never forget how bill and hillary clinton handled haiti the last time to all our friends in little haiti theyre great people i mean i spent a long time these are people that are incredible they have the warmest feeling the warmest heart but to all of our friends in little haiti your day of justice is coming believe me and it arrives on november 8 november 8 get out and votethe new emails also show members of the clinton team viciously attacking catholics and evangelicals they attacked catholics and evangelicals viciously and that wont be tolerated but it wont be tolerated by the voters tell you what anybody of religion i really think you have to vote for donald trump to be honest with you i really do believe it and in all of the primaries you saw that i wasnt expected to win with evangelicals but once we got started and once they heard my message as opposed to other people messages we really we won big with evangelicals theyre incredible people remember the johnson amendment were gonna get rid of that johnson amendment just remember that these emails are just the latest evidence of the hatred that the clinton campaign has for everyday faithful americans true the wikileaks email show that hillary clinton staff even has to give her secret notes on when she needs to smile smile hillary smile hey folks we have to get back to work our country in trouble we cant play games anymore smile you believe it smile and how about where it said to the public you say this but to the others that give you the money you say that ill tell you it so revealing somebody going to do a great book on that because the press just did not little tiny stories big big things getting answers for debates and questions for debates before the debate takes place how about thatill tell you what can you imagine me if any of this stuff pertained to me front page headlines all over the world donald trump oh well weve been there and we seem to be doing really wellhillary clinton commonly referred to as crooked hillary thinks that you all of you are deplorable and totally irredeemable i actually think irredeemable is worse i dont know im the only one deplorable and irredeemable irredeemable meaning meaning you can never ever come back i call you hardworking american patriots and together we are going to save this country and we are going to make america great again and it hot as hell in here but i dont care call it florida right florida emails also show that the dnc vicechair was feeding information so much information to the candidate oh man i want that why cant the republicans do that why cant reince feed me information prior to a debate im so angry at the republicans i want to be fed information like hillary gets and we still beat her badly right so i mean what the big deal but i want information the republicans are not doing their job they should be able to get me all of the questions prior to the debatethis all comes after a secret tape that shows hillary clinton calling bernie voters now look bernie i feel sorry for berniehe made a deal with the devil and he blew his reputation but she called bernie voters basement dwellersso all of the bernie votes out there join our movement like all of these young people were going to fix our trade deals and get special interests out of governmentand by the way by the time this ends ill have over a hundred million dollars of my money in this thing right which means that 100 million of people that dont have to give me money and say donald will you do this will you do that will you do that that a lot of money and i asked her the other night i said you know i will have over a hundred million and that a lot of money if i lose im going to be so angry at florida ill still love you i think maybe not you know one of the pundits said and youve heard me say this maybe but they said mr trump it doesnt matter whether you win or lose you have done the single greatest job nobody ever done a thing like this before no matter where we go it like this but they said it the single bill oreilly said it but many peoples said it the single greatest political phenomena theyve ever seen i said wait a minute youre wrongif i dont win on november 8th i will consider this the single greatest waste of time energy and money of anything ive ever done because were not going to be able to reduce your taxes were not going to be able to save your second amendment appoint supreme court judges take care of you vets fix up your depleted very depleted the greatest people on earth but our military is so depletedwere going to take care of a lot of things including getting the drugs out a vote for hillary is a vote for more reckless foreign invasions what a mess did she do does she go down as the alltime worstmore wall street cheating more terrible trade deals and as wikileaks showed she wants to cut your medicare and social security benefits you didnt see that see and im not going to the press doesnt report that she wants to cut your social security and she wants to cut medicare and one of the big advantages of me having a rather large microphone meaning a lot of people are listening is that i can talk about wikileaks and look it on al the television networks live were live amazing i think they are just turning them all off now watch you go home theyll say why did it end so abruptlya vote for trump is a vote for america first and it a vote to protect medicare and social security and lower your taxes big big tax decrease were going to lower your taxes wikileaks also shows something ive been warning about for a very very long time the media is simply an extension of the clinton campaign it one of the biggest ways that our system is rigged and i was the first one to use that term when i was running in the primaries when i won louisiana and i got fewer delegates than people that i beat easilyand my people said oh no that the way the system i say well then the system wrong! how do you win a state and you get less delegatesand i said this system is rigged! and it was but we figured out how to win right that what you need won in a landslide i got more votes than anybody in the history of the republican party in the primaries system by far wasnt even close reporters who work for these outlets like the washington post or the new york times may think of themselves as journalists but theyre actually cogs for a corrupt political machine that the clinton machine the email show the new york times the boston globe univision who i sued i sued univision and i was very happy with what they did and this lightweight you know john hardwood this lightweight this guy who came out he was shaking he was so nervoushe asked me the first question mr trump could you answer this question what a lightweight they shoulda fired him for what he didjohn harwood i hate to make him famous but cause nobody ever heard of him before but a total lightweight of cnbc all doing favors for the clintonsand reporters smothering the clintons with praise the new york times even gave clinton a call to give her a veto power over her quotes in a story that was already written nobody ever called me and said hi mr trump we wrote a story would you read the story and please give us a little feedback would you like us to take anything outthis system is so rigged now this is all down in the emails she had veto power over what she saidill tell you what i want to have that too i want to have veto poweri used to get such good publicity folks now i mean it like it incredible i used to get my life was so simplemy life was so simple i had a beautiful simple life it was goingi built an unbelievable company and then i decide to do this and my life became slightly more complexyou know we have people in this audience right now that 18 years ago had one great job they were making more money 18 years ago than theyre making now and now they have two and sometimes three jobs in other words theyre older and theyre working harder and theyre making lessnot a good not a good assemblage of facts here the only good news im also older and working harder than ive ever worked beforeok that i can tell you including being in this wonderful area at 114 degrees temperature which is great cause you go home and you lose weight i mean why you cant be you go home you say i feel great i lost a lot of weightby the way let hillary clinton stand up here for an hour and talk the way i talk and let see how long she lasts folks oh what a joke what a total joke our country in such trouble that why im i it just so ridiculousthe corporate media cant report on the establishment because the corporate media is the establishment such a big part of it were going to break up the special interest monopoly and were going to win this country back for the american people were gonna do it too the emails also reveal that hillary clinton believes in global governments unlimited immigration unlimited much more than obama from the middle east come right in come right in550 percent more than president obama who is grossly incompetent he doesnt know what the hell he doing and why is he campaigning we just had a horrible jobs report we have no growth you saw gdp at one percent we have no growth we have a horrible jobs report china is ripping us off japan is ripping us off with the cars mexico has a unbelievable deal with us both on the border i mean look at our trade deficit with mexico and china and vietnam and everybodylast year our country had a trade deficit of almost 800 billion 800 billion who the hell negotiates these deals i mean can you believe it so i say why the hell is obama allowed to campaign for hillary clinton he always campaigning and he doing his little thing you know having a good time he ought to be out in the white house he not there long he ought to be there working and fixing some of these horrible trade deals and bringing jobs back to our country not campaigning for a crooked person for a totally dishonest and crooked person speaking in secret to a foreign bank hillary clinton said my dream is a hemispheric common market that not good for your jobs with totally open trade and open borders 600 million people could pour into the united states youll have nothing lefttell you if that happens i know the real estate here i love the real estate here sell fast behind closed doors when she thought no one was listening she pledged to dissolve the borders of the united states of america this all came out she said she wants to dissolve the borders and here i am saying we want strong borders we dont want drugs coming in we dont want crime coming in i dont know maybe im wasting my time am i wasting my time i dont think so she doesnt want to have any borders total amnesty tell you what folks this is the last time youll ever have a chance to save our country it not going to happen you wont be able to the numbers will be too great already the republican nominee has a massive disadvantage and especially when you have the leaders not putting their weight behind the people theyre not putting their weight behind the peopleinstead of calling me and saying congratulations you did a great job you absolutely destroyed her in the debate like everybody said you know pat buchanan wrote the big article today you saw itim not bragging im just sayingmaybe a little bit but herehe said it was the single greatest debate performance in the history of presidential politics so wouldnt you think that paul ryan would call and say good going in front of just about the largest audience for a second night debate in the history of the country so you know youd think that theyd say great going don let go let beat this crook she a crook let beat her we got to stop it no he doesnt do thatthere a whole deal going on there i mean you know there a whole deal going on and were going to figure it out i always figure things out but there a whole sinister deal going oncrooked hillary wants to end forever the american independence that our founders gave us our great founders are spinning in their graves our founders are spinning in their graves like douglas macarthur like george patton like our generals theyre spinning in their grave and by the way general flynn and all the generals  over 200 admirals and generals have endorsed donald trumptwo hundred over 200 twentyone congressional medal of honor recipients have endorsed donald trump ill tell you you know what i like very smart tough people like me i like that the smart tough people they like trumpamerican soldiers have fought and died to win and keep america freedom and now hillary clinton wants to surrender that freedom to open borders open trade and world government and i do believe in free trade but i believe more in smart tradewere going to make great deals with other countries were going to bring jobs back were going to bring jobs back im not running to be president of the world im running to be president of the united states of america oh i wish those cameras would turn so some time our friends back in new york and back in pennsylvania and back in ohio and all these different states they could see the crowds but they do hear it you know when you hear the noise they say they never show the crowd but you hear the crowd you cant imitate that noise we will never surrender the freedom and sovereignty of the united states it going to be america first america first america first and yesterday hillary had al gore  climate change now i want  just so you know  do you know that ive won numerous environmental awards im a believer in the environment it got to be within reason im a believer here what i want though i want immaculately clean water and i want immaculately clean air that what i want that called climate change that called environmental protection but hillary had this deal very very lightly attended and i watched on television as they said this is the largest crowd that she had you know what she got like a tiny little fraction now theyre not going to say look at the crowd with crooked hillary yesterday she had al gore get up this poor guy i dont know what the hell happened to him what happened to him she had al gore get up because dont forget obama thinks that climate change is the single biggest and most dangerous problem for the world today not nuclear weapons in the hands of maniacs or in the hands of countries that hate us no no that no problem climate change is our problem ill tell you how this going how were doing folks if we dont win this election i dont know what im going to do i dont know no no can you imagine here a guy where we have isis that he essentially founded if you look remember i said founded and he going to get the medal for havingand i kiddingly but it really not that kiddingly but then they put it on mo bisely he found and i says let me tell you something when they pulled out of iraq the way theywe should have never been in iraq and i was against it and they know itbut we should have never been in iraq but when we were the way he pulled out he announced when he leaving he pulled out everybody instead of leaving groups behind and they created a vacuum and isis was formed now think of this because the biggest thing that came out of the debate in my opinion and it really came out of the first debate which if i didnt have fixed microphone or a broken microphone nobody been able to tell me but i watchedcouldnt talk very good because my mike didnt work but i watched and i said you know it interesting hillary said she going to do this and this and this but she been there for 30 years she never did it and i said to her in the second debate i said let me ask you a question let meand by the way you know that socalled commission on presidential debates the head guy used to work for bill clinton did you know that i just found that out the head guy worked for bill clinton what a rigged deal this is but here the story i have no respect for that group by the way i have none it sounds good presidential commission give me a break that why i was so happy what we did to annihilate the enemy the other day so happy because were dealing against a very dishonest system but hillary so important wants to have a radical and this is very radical immigration she wants to radicalize immigration where you have people pouring in remember this the border patrol agents 16500 gave me their endorsement last week ice ice these are great people you dont hear great things because theyre not allowed to do their jobthese are people that frankly would work a lot less i mean their job easier if hillary wins because basically all they have to do is stand there and watch people walk in front of them ice these are great people tough people smart people first time in their history they endorse me theyve got to work harder and they endorse me and one of the things they told me that i thought was terrible is that she refused when she was secretary of state to make foreign countries take back their criminal aliens in other words we have somebody in from a foreign country illegally the person kills somebody hurts somebody robs a store robs a bank does all sortssells drugs all over the place poisons our youth and we want to send them back to the country from which they came and they bring them back and the country says were not taking thembecause theyre smart they dont want them so they bring them back into the united states and put him into our society i guarantee you and you can mark my words and there a lot of tape running that wont happen once when donald trump is president not once guarantee you that one convicted criminal alien she allowed to go freetotally free killed a young girl named casey chadwick beautiful young girl the corrupt establishment in washington wants to surrender america borders even as they send our troops overseas to protect the borders of other countries shell protect those borders but not our borderscasey chadwick was a great example and he was let free and she should be alive today jamiel shaw has a sonhad a son a great young man killed violently and i dont know if you know but killed violently by an illegal immigrant shot three times in the face for no reason somebody that wasnt supposed to be hereand you haveyou have case after case after case were not going to have it anymore were not going to be the stupid people anymore were not going to be the stupid weak people anymore a trump administration will secure control defend and protect the borders of the united states as sure as you are standing here today we will 100 percent build the wall 100 percent are you ready are you ready and who is going to pay for the wall mexico100 percent they just dont know it yet they dont know it yet but 100 percent theyll pay for the wallhey look were going to have a great relationship with mexico and china and all of these countries that are ripping us off and now have no respect theyre going to make less and theyre going to like us more funny how that works but it true mexico is making a fortune with trade theyre taking our jobs so many things they are going to respect us finallywe will stop the drugs from pouring into our country florida has seen a 470 percent increase in heroin deaths think of thatthink if you have a child470 percent increase in heroin deaths since 2007 think of that think of your kids and your grandkidswere going to stop it and most of it coming across the southern border and let me tell you when we allow ice and when we allow the border patrol agents and when we give them that big beautiful wall with a door in it so people can come in but they have to come in legally we want them to come in but they have to come in legally we will stop the drugs from poisoning our youth and others but i have a message for the drug dealers for the gang members and the criminal cartels your days are numbered believe me your days are numbered hillary also wants a 550 percent increase in syrian refugees we dont know anything about them this even though she admitted in private according to wikileaks just out that she knows terrorists are trying to infiltrateshe knows ittheyre trying to infiltrate our refugee program so she said it just yesterday that she knows theyre trying to come in through that method and yet she wants 550 percent more than even obama staggeringly high numbers thousands and thousandswe cant let it happen and we all have a heart and well build safe havens and well have the gulf states pay because theyre not doing their share believe me theyre not they have plenty of money theyll pay we cant pay we owe 20 trillion 20 trillion doubled during obama years doubled he doubled the debt during his yearsin fact the terrorists have already infiltrated our country there are now 1000 open isis investigations in our 50 states a record attack after attack including the recent terror strikes in new jersey new york minnesota as well as the mall shooting in washington were made possible by our extremely open immigration system that meant only to protect fools and were not fools so let me state this clearly as i can i am going to keep radical islamic terrorists the hell out of our country she wont even use the word she wont even use the term our incompetent presidenti call him our campaign presidentour incompetent president wont use the term radical islamic terrorism he wont use it he tries to explain it he spends hours trying to explain why if you dont identify your problem folks youre never going to get rid of it it only getting worseand remember i said it before weve started off when he became president with no isis nobody head the term isis which he calls isil right you know why he does that because he likes disturbing all of you he calls isil but we started off we had no isis and now 7 1/2 years later theyre in they think 32 countriesand she going to get rid of them i can tell you this they are hoping and they are prayingthey are hoping and praying that hillary clinton becomes president of the united states because theyll take over not only that part of the world theyll take over this country theyll take over this part of the world believe me they are hopingand by the way she likes to say they want mei will be their worst nightmare im going to be their worst nightmare and she lied during the debate remember when i said the red line in the sand right she said i wasnt secretary of state then all flustered all crazy she was there when they drew the line i walked out they said you know she was there oh well she sort of said she wasnt she was thereit turned out to be a lie and even the media said that they hated  she lied about that she lied about many thingsshe put iran on the path to nuclear weapons you know this horrible iran deal where they gave 400 million in cash but it turned out to be 17 billion in cash you couldnt fit that in the back of this arena that how much money it isshe gave  they gave that much money to the terrorists to our enemies and by the way our enemies arent even nice to us now theyre emboldenedyou see the little boats going around our beautiful ships doing all sorts of little things to drive our people crazy folks theyre not gonna do that stuff when im president i guarantee ya you see the way they captured our ten sailors cause they were a little bit in the wrong waters and instead of saying nicely hey listen you gotta be over there a little bit they humiliated the sailors humiliated their families and humiliated our country rightand the only reason they let em go is that our payments of 150 billion started the next day so stupid theyre notand when they fly  they  they flew right alongside of our  our planes the other you saw that their jet fightersright you saw that and when putin is buzzing  you know hillary tough with russiayou ever notice anything that goes wrong they blame russia russia did it they have no idea were being hacked because we have people that dont know what theyre doingthey have people but they always blame russia and then they say donald trump is friends with putini dont know putin folks i promise i dont know putinwhat the hell do i have to do with putin these people are professional con people theyre

crooked hillary clinton hillary wants to blame everyone else for amounting legal troubles and i dont see if youve watched her last few speeches over the last few days she has become totally unhinged unbelievablewhat she saying and what she doing is actually it unbelievable but she has no one to blame but herself hillary is the one who set up the illegal private email server to shield her criminal activityhillary is the one who engaged in a corrupt pay for play scheme at the state department hillary is the one who lied so many times to congress and to the fbi hilary is the one who made 13 phones disappear some with a hammer and who destroyed 33000 emails after after after after receiving a congressional subpoena think of that unbelievable and as you know they just foundlisten to this and i guess you know it 650000 emails and i would say that classified confidential i think theyre probably all over the place i think theyrei think theyre gonna find a treasure trough i cant even imaginein fact they said well this is ok theyre duplicates how could there be duplicates when its many more times what we thought was stolen in the first place rightyou know when they deleted 33000 i thought that was a lot they have 650000 hillary is the one who accepted debate questions given to her in advance and used them to cheat instead of reporting the breach that a big deal you know to me that a big deal some people say oh that fine that a big deal that reallythat a real cheater ok that a cheaterand she was given the questions by a woman that frankly should resigned from the dnc or be fired but that a really big deal and you notice they neverthe dishonest prospect the most dishonest if you notice they never go after hillary they always talk about donna brazile donna brazile didnt do it but can you imagine if i gotcan you imagine they gave the questions to donald trump before a debate you know it would be the electric chair theyd reinstitute the electric chair noitd be headlines all over the world this isnt headlinesi bring it up it brought up a little bit but this isnt like a big deal she got the debate questions and answersbut she got the debate questions prior to a debate now bernie sanders should be angry right shouldnt he be angrynow ill tell you what the system is rigged the system is riggedive been saying it for ait rigged and were gonna straighten it out but the system is rigged hillary is not the victim the american people are the victims of this system so corrupt in so many ways and this is your one chance to change it because you know whatin four

anythingno no how do you work how do you do it650000 theyll have to explain that to us some daybut theyll have some things in there that i can just imagine are going to be unbelievable hillary likely to be under investigation for many years probably concluding in a criminal trialout today wikileaks just came out with a new one just a little while ago it just been shown that a rigged system with more collusion possibly illegal between the department of justice the clinton campaign and the state departmentyou saw that the emails show that the assistant attorney general who involved in the

48,the hillary clinton documents released by wikileaks make more clear than ever just how much is at stake in this election this election will determine whether we remain a free country or we become a corrupt banana republic controlled by large donors and foreign governmentsthe election of hillary clinton would lead to the destruction of our countrytoday we learned the department of justice fed information to the clinton campaign about the email investigation so that the campaign could be prepared to cover up her crimes this is collusion and corruption of the highest order and is one more reason why i will ask my attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor we have to investigate the investigationhillary bleached and deleted 33000 emails after a congressional subpoena  and then destroyed her phones with a hammer  all to coverup her crimes people have gone to jail for doing far less she also lost as much as 6 billion taxpayer dollarsthese wikileaks emails confirm what those of us here today have known all along hillary clinton is the vessel for a corrupt global establishment that is raiding our country and surrendering our sovereignty this criminal government cartel doesnt recognize borders but believes in global governance unlimited immigration and rule by corporationseven chelsea clinton the wikileaks emails show expressed serious concerns about conflicts of interests at the clinton foundation and state departmentduring a recent trip to florida i had a chance to spend some time with the incredible residents of little haiti the haitian community has contributed so much to this country i also learned from them firsthand how much they despise the clintons for what they did to the people of haitinew emails revealed today by abc news show that during the deadly earthquake in haiti which killed over 150000 people the clintons couldnt stop cashing in as people were dying in haiti clinton insiders were separating out requests from friends of bill or william jefferson clinton vips so that their business interests or contracts would receive special treatmentpeople who were labeled not friends of bill were placed on the sidelinesin their biggest project the clintons used 400 million in aid and us taxpayer funds to build what amounted to a sweatshop and guess who set it up cheryl mills hillary chief of staff who helped destroy her emails and then got an immunity deal from the fbi that included the destruction of her computerthe company that benefitted from mills actions then invested in a company owned by cheryl millstoday as haiti death toll from hurricane matthew is on the rise we should never forget how bill and hillary clinton handled haiti last timeto all of our friends in haiti your day of justice is coming and it arrives on november 8thnot only have the clintons ripped off haiti but the new emails show members of the clinton team attacking catholics this is deeply offensive it just the latest evidence of the hatred that the clinton campaign has for everyday americans weve all read the reports and heard the stories about how disrespectfully she treats law enforcement secret service and others in uniform she even smeared all of america police officers as essentially racistim proud of the fact that i have always treated the working people of this country with dignity and respect especially our military and law enforcement personnelthe wikileaks emails show that hillary staff even has to give her secret notes on when she needs to smilethe emails also show yet again that the dnc rigged the democratic election to give it to hillary clinton the dnc vice chair was caught feeding information about bernie sanders plans to the clinton campaignto all the bernie voters out there dont vote for a wall street sellout like hillary clinton a vote for hillary is a vote for more reckless foreign invasions more wall street cheating more terrible trade deals and  as confirmed by wikileaks  she also wants to cut medicare and social securitywikileaks also shows something i have been warning about for a very long time the media is simply an extension of the clinton campaign it just one more way the system is riggedreporters who work for these outlets  like the washington post or the new york times  may think of themselves as journalists but they are actually just cogs in a corporate political machinethe emails show the new york times boston globe univision and jon harwood of cnbc all doing favors for the clintons and smother the clintons with praise the nyt even gave clinton veto power of her quotes in their stories it called corruptionthe emails also show that the hillary was given the cnn townhall questions before her big debate against bernie sanders dona brazile the dnc vice chair emailed from time to time i get the questions in advancethe media cant report on the establishment because the media is the establishment and theyre all teamed up against you the american peopleon november 8th the arrogance of washington dc will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the american voterwe are going to replace our corrupt global establishment that has failed us on borders on

a real wage increase in 18 yearsthe people getting rich off of our rigged system have sent tens of millions of dollars to hillary clinton  much of it to her personal bank account  to keep you from

every disadvantaged child in america to be able to attend the public or private school that is right for them and their familyin this future we are also going to keep our country out of the endless wars that have defined hillary clinton careerto keep our country out of war we will remember those three very famous words peace through strengththat means rebuilding our badly depleted military i laid out a detailed plan this week to reinvest in our military and our troopswe are going to build a 350 ship navy a 540000 soldier army an air force of 1200 combatready fighter jets and a marine core built on 36 battalions crucially we are also going to pursue a stateoftheart missile defensewe will start by modernizing our cruisers to provide the ballistic missile defense capability our nation needsas we expand our navy toward the goal of 350 ships we will also procure additional modern destroyers that are designed to handle the missile defense mission in the coming yearsjust today we were reminded of the need for missile defense after north korea performed its fourth nuclear test since hillary clinton became secretary of stateone more massive hillary clinton failurejust like she failed in iran and put them on the path to nuclear weaponshillary clinton has presided over the greatest series of foreign policy failures and blunders anyone has ever seen her policies have produced massive global disordershe handed iraq over to isis unleashing that terror group onto the world isis would not be threatening the west today if not for the decisions hillary clinton madeshe helped destabilize egypt by supporting the ouster of president mubarak in exchange for the muslim brotherhood fortunately president elsisi is now in charge but terrorists have gained a foothold in that countryshe helped push syria into a prolonged civil war by pushing regime change in that country too  without any plan for the day aftershe failed with china which has only grown more aggressive by the way she also let china steal hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual propertyand of course hillary clinton failed with her russian reset she gave up missile defense in poland and the czech republic in exchange for nothing in return then she gave up 20 of us uranium to russia while those who benefited from the deal gave money to the clintonslet not forget russia went into crimea on president obama watchunlike clinton and obama we will negotiate with russia from a position of strength  not weakness and weakness is all we get from president obama and hillary clintonthe difference between me and my opponent on vladimir putin and in all negotiations is that i negotiate by creating leverage so i can extract a good deal for the united stateshillary clinton negotiates but never gets anything of value for the united states putin laughs at our leaders and takes them to the cleaners again and againthat is why we will rebuild our military strengthen our economy and regain our position of leadership in the world  so we can negotiate from a position of great strength once againif i cannot get a good deal for the united states i will follow the example of ronald reagan and walk away that is completely contrary to the way president obama and hillary clinton negotiate which gets nothing of value for the united states ever they just keep losingi will end this legacy of failure and strongly defend the interests of the united statesbut i will also keep focused on the ultimate goal we will not seek endless conflict and hostility we wont get trapped in the failed approaches of the past a future where america can find common ground with countries like russia and china is a better future for our childrenwe will pursue these relationships with our eyes wide open and a clear understanding of our many many differences i will advocate the american position with a strength and clarity president obama and hillary clinton never have no more apology tours no more bowing to foreign powers we proudly defend america at every single turnamerica will get the respect it deservesand if we dont i will walk away from the deal like youve never seen anyone walk before and believe me within a short while they will come back  but only on my terms therefore the terms of the american peopleon these principles we will pursue our longterm goals of peace  for the sake of our kids and for the sake of the world futurehillary clinton has failed in every single country where she has ever gotten involved and at a very high price for the worldher policies have produced only death and destruction not diplomacy she triggerhappy pushing recklessly for regime change  but never creating or promoting stability or advancing the core interests of the united statesher only real achievement as secretary of state has been getting away with her massive email scandal she bleached deleted and destroyed her emails after a subpoena from congressshe lied to congress while under oath and smashed her phones with a hammer to keep them from getting to authoritiesby the way who has thirteen phones in the first place only somebody with a whole lot to hideand we all know what hillary clinton was hiding she was hiding her payforplay scandals as secretary of statehillary clinton isnt just part of the corrupt establishment she is the corrupt establishmenti just saw her press conference today where hillary clinton complained about all of the problems in the world if only wed had a competent secretary of state who could have prevented all of these problems from happeningthroughout it all hillary clinton and her foundation raked in millions and millions of dollars from the most oppressive and brutal regimes on earth hillary clinton and her foundation have cozied up to regimes that oppress and brutalize women that murder gays and that violate human rights on an unimaginable scalemy administration will be a voice for all people who are oppressed including the millions of women being oppressed by radical islamhillary clinton has been there for 30 years and produced only failure yet people keep giving her money and protecting herit the powerful protecting the powerfulthe insiders fighting for insidersi am fighting for youall the people advising hillary clinton are the people responsible for the endless wars and conflicts and the tragedies in the middle easti am proud to have the support of the retired generals and admirals who know how to win  and how to avoid endless warlet me also take this moment to express our deepest thanks and gratitude to everyone who has worn the uniform but most especially to those who have given the ultimate sacrifice for this countrythere is no greater expression of love than the love shown by the men and women who have laid down their lives for their country and its peopleit is our duty to ensure that their sacrifices are not in vain that means we dont issue timetables for political reasons but that we work with our generals and our leaders to produce a real plan for victorywe will pursue a new steady foreign policy that seeks to advance the national security interests of the united states  not a reckless interventionist globalism that has failed this country so badlyand we will be clear in naming our enemy radical islamic terrorismthe fact that hillary clinton cant even say these words proves how unfit she is to lead this country this is one single fact she can never escapeany country that shares our goal of defeating this enemy will be our partner in this missionwe will break the cycle of regime change and refugee crisis that has gone on for so many yearswe simply cant afford to continue down the road we are on right nowthat applies to everythingchange is needed at every single level of our societywhen

50,today i am here to talk about three crucial words that should be at the center of our foreign policy peace through strengthwe want to achieve a stable peaceful world with less conflict and more common groundi am proposing a new foreign policy focused on advancing america core national interests promoting regional stability and producing an easing of tensions in the world this will require rethinking the failed policies of the pastwe can make new friends rebuild old alliances and bring new allies into the foldim proud to have the support of warfighting generals active duty military and the top experts who know both how to win  and how to avoid the endless wars we are caught in now just yesterday 88 top generals and admirals endorsed my campaignin a trump administration our actions in the middle east will be tempered by realism the current strategy of toppling regimes with no plan for what to do the day after only produces power vacuums that are filled by terroristsgradual reform not sudden and radical change should be our guiding objective in that regionwe should work with any country that shares our goal of destroying isis and defeating radical islamic terrorism and form new friendships and partnerships based on this mission we now have an administration and a former secretary of state who refuse to say radical islamic terrorismimmediately after taking office i will ask my generals to present to me a plan within 30 days to defeat and destroy isisthis will require military warfare but also cyber warfare financial warfare and ideological warfare  as i laid out in my speech on defeating radical islamic terrorism several weeks agoinstead of an apology tour i will proudly promote our system of government and our way of life as the best in the world  just like we did in our campaign against communism during the cold warwe will show the whole world how proud we are to be americanat the same time immigration security is a vital part of our national securitywe only want to admit people to our country who will support our values and love our peoplethese are the pillars of a sound national security strategyunlike my opponent my foreign policy will emphasize diplomacy not destruction hillary clinton legacy in iraq libya and syria has produced only turmoil and suffering her destructive policies have displaced millions of people then she has invited the refugees into the west with no plan to screen themincluding veteran healthcare costs the price of the wars in iraq and afghanistan could total 6 trillion according to a report in the washington examiner yet after all this money spent and lives lost clinton policies as secretary of state have left the middle east in more disarray than ever beforemeanwhile china has grown more aggressive and north korea more dangerous and belligerent russia has defied this administration at every turn putin has no respect for president obama or hillary clintonsometimes it has seemed like there wasnt a country in the middle east that hillary clinton didnt want to invade intervene or topple she is triggerhappy and unstable when it comes to warhillary clinton is just reckless  so reckless in fact she put her emails on an illegal server that our enemies could easily hack then clinton team used a technology called bleachbit to acid wash her emails they even took a hammer to some of her 13 phones to cover her tracks and obstruct justice these email records were destroyed after she received a subpoena to turn them overin the fbi report she claimed she couldnt recall important information on 39 occasionsshe cant even remember whether she was trained in classified information and said she didnt even know the letter c means confidentialif she cant remember such crucial events and information she is unfit to be commanderinchiefher conduct is simply disqualifyingshe talks about her experience but hillary clinton only foreign policy experience is failure everywhere she got involved things got worselet look back at the middle east at the very beginning of 2009 before hillary clinton was sworninlibya was stablesyria was under controlegypt was ruled by a secular president and an ally of the united statesiraq was experiencing a reduction in violence the group that would become what we now call isis was close to being extinguishediran was being choked off by economic sanctionsfastforward to today what have the decisions of obamaclinton producedlibya is in ruins our ambassador and three other brave americans are dead and isis has gained a new base of operationssyria is in the midst of a disastrous civil war isis controls large portions of territory a refugee crisis now threatens europe and the united states and hundreds of thousands are deadin egypt terrorists have gained a foothold in the sinai desert near the suez canal one of the most essential waterways in the worldiraq is in chaos and isis is on the looseisis has spread across the middle east and into the westiran the world largest state sponsor of terrorism is now flush with 150 billion dollars in cash released by the united states  plus another 17 billion dollars in cash ransom payments in other words our country was blackmailed and extorted into paying this unheardof amount of moneyworst of all the nuclear deal puts iran the number one state sponsor of radical islamic terrorism on a path to nuclear weaponsthis is hillary clinton foreign policy legacybut that not all president obama and hillary clinton have also overseen deep cuts in our military which only invite more aggression from our adversarieshistory shows that when america is not prepared is when the danger is greatest we want to deter avoid and prevent conflict through our unquestioned military strengthunder barack obama and hillary clinton defense spending is on track to fall to its lowest level as a share of the economy since the end of world war ii we currently have the smallest army since 1940 the navy is among the smallest it has been since 1915 and the air force is the smallest it has been since 1947when ronald reagan left office our navy had 592 ships when barack obama took office it had 285 ships today the navy has just 276 shipsthe average air force aircraft is 27 yearsold we have 2nd generation b52 bombers  their fathers flew the same planeour army has been shrinking rapidly from 553000 soldiers in 2009 to just 479000 todayin 2009 our marine corps had 202000 active marines today it just 182000our ship count is below the minimum of 308 that the navy says is needed to execute its current missions president obama plans to reduce the army to 450000 troopswhich would hamstring our ability to defend the united statesit takes 22 years on average to field a major new weapons systemin 2010 the us spent 554 billion on nonwar base defense spendingin the current year we are spending 548 billion  a cut of 10 in real inflationadjusted dollars this reduction was done through what is known as the sequester or automatic defense budget cuts under the budget agreement defense took half of the cuts  even though it makes up only onesixth of the budgetas soon as i take office i will ask congress to fully eliminate the defense sequester and will submit a new budget to rebuild our militarythis will increase certainty in the defense community as to funding and will allow military leaders to plan for our future defense needsas part of removing the defense sequester i will ask congress to fully offset the costs of increased military spending in the process we will make government leaner and more responsive to the publici will ask that savings be accomplished through common sense reforms that eliminate government waste and budget gimmicks  and that protect hardearned benefits for americansgovernmentwide improper government payments are estimated to exceed 135 billion per year and the amount of unpaid taxes is estimated to be as high as 385 billionwe can also reduce the size of the federal bureaucracy through responsible workforce attrition  that is when employees retire they can be replaced by a smaller number of new employeeswe can also stop funding programs that are not authorized in law congress spent 320 billion last year on 256 expired laws removing just 5 percent of that will reduce spending by almost 200 billion over 10 yearsthe military will not be exempt either  the military bureaucracy will have to be trimmed as wellearly in my term i will also be requesting that all nato nations promptly pay their bills which many are not doing right now only 5 nato countries including the united states are currently meeting the minimum requirement to spend 2 of gdp on defenseadditionally i will be respectfully asking countries such as germany japan south korea and saudi arabia to pay more for the tremendous security we provide themfinally we will have at our disposal additional revenues from unleashing american energy the institute for energy research cites a shortrun figure of as much as 36 billion annually from increased energy productionusing these new funds i will ask my secretary of defense to propose a new defense budget to meet the following longterm goalswe will build an active army of around 540000 as the army chief of staff has said he needs we now have only 31 brigade combat teams or 490000 troops and only onethird of combat teams are considered combatreadywe will build a marine corps based on 36 battalions which the heritage foundation notes is the minimum needed to deal with major contingencies  we have 23 nowwe will build a navy of 350 surface ships and submarines as recommended by the bipartisan national defense panel  we have 276 ships nowand we will build an air force of at least 1200 fighter aircraft which the heritage foundation has shown to be needed to execute current missions  we have 1113 nowwe will also seek to develop a state of the art missile defense systemunder obamaclinton our ballistic missile defense capability has been degraded at the very moment the us and its allies are facing a heightened missile threat from states like iran and north korea as these potential adversaries grow their missile programs us military facilities in asia and the middle east as well as our allies are increasingly in range with the united states homeland also potentially threatenedwe propose to rebuild the key tools of missile defense starting with the navy cruisers that are the foundation of our missile defense capabilities in europe asia and the middle east the obamaclinton administration tried repeatedly to remove our cruisers from service then refused to modernize these aging shipswe will start by modernizing our cruisers to provide the ballistic missile defense capability our nation needs this will cost around 220 million per modernization as we seek to modernize a significant portion of these 22 shipsas we expand our navy toward the goal of 350 ships we will also procure additional modern destroyers that are designed to handle the missile defense mission in the coming yearsaccomplishing this military rebuild will be a fiftystate effort every state in the union will be able to take part in rebuilding our military and developing the technologies of tomorrowin addition we will improve the department of defense cyber capabilities hillary clinton has taught us all how vulnerable we are to cyber hackingwhich is why one of the first things we must do is to enforce all classification rules and enforce all laws relating to the handling of classified informationhillary clinton put her emails on a secret server to coverup her payforplay scandals at the state department nothing threatens the integrity of our democracy more than when government officials put their public office up for salewe will also make it a priority to develop defensive and offensive cyber capabilities at our us cyber command and recruit the best and brightest americansone of my first directives after taking office will be asking the joint chiefs of staff and all relevant federal departments to conduct a thorough review of united states cyber defenses and identify all vulnerabilities  in our power grid our communications systems and all vital infrastructure i will then ask for a plan to immediately protect those vulnerabilities at the same time we will invest heavily in offensive cyber capabilities to disrupt our enemies including terrorists who rely heavily on internet communicationsthese new investments in cybersecurity and the modernization of our military will spur substantial new job creation in the private sector and help create the jobs and technologies of tomorrowamerica must be the world dominant technological powerhouse of the 21st century and young americans  including in our inner cities  should get these new jobswe must also ensure that we have the best medical care education and support for our military service members and their families  both when they serve and when they return to civilian lifeour debt to our men and women in uniform is eternalto all those who have served this nation i say i will never let you downwe will protect those who protect usand we will follow their example of unity we will work across all racial and income lines to create one american nationtogether we will have one great american futurewe will be one people under one god saluting one american flagamerica will be a prosperous generous and inclusive societywe will discard the failed policies and division of the past and embrace true american change to rebuild our economy rebuild our inner cities and rebuild our countrywe will bring back our jobswe will make america strong againwe will make america safe againand we will make america great again
51,wow thank you that a lot of people phoenix that a lot of peoplethank you very muchthank you phoenix i am so glad to be back in arizonathe state that has a very very special place in my heart i love people of arizona and together we are going to win the white house in novembernow you know this is where it all began for me remember that massive crowd also so i said let go and have some fun tonight were going to arizona okthis will be a little bit different this wont be a rally speech per se instead im going to deliver a detailed policy address on one of the greatest challenges facing our country today illegal immigrationive just landed having returned from a very important and special meeting with the president of mexico a man i like and respect very much and a man who truly loves his country mexicoand by the way just like i am a man who loves my country the united stateswe agree on the importance of ending the illegal flow of drugs cash guns and people across our border and to put the cartels out of businesswe also discussed the great contributions of mexicanamerican citizens to our two countries my love for the people of mexico and the leadership and friendship between mexico and the united states it was a thoughtful and substantive conversation and it will go on for awhile and in the end were all going to win both countries were all going to winthis is the first of what i expect will be many many conversations and in a trump administration were going to go about creating a new relationship between our two countries but it going to be a fair relationship we want fairnessbut to fix our immigration system we must change our leadership in washington and we must change it quicklysadly sadly there is no other way the truth is our immigration system is worse than anybody ever realized but the facts arent known because the media wont report on them the politicians wont talk about them and the special interests spend a lot of money trying to cover them up because they are making an absolute fortune that the way it istoday on a very complicated and very difficult subject you will get the truth the fundamental problem with the immigration system in our country is that it serves the needs of wealthy donors political activists and powerful powerful politicians it all you can do thank you thank youlet me tell you who it does not serve it does not serve you the american people doesnt serve you when politicians talk about immigration reform they usually mean the following amnesty open borders lower wages immigration reform should mean something else entirely it should mean improvements to our laws and policies to make life better for american citizensthank you but if were going to make our immigration system work then we have to be prepared to talk honestly and without fear about these important and very sensitive issues for instance we have to listen to the concerns that working people our forgotten working people have over the record pace of immigration and it impact on their jobs wages housing schools tax bills and general living conditionsthese are valid concerns expressed by decent and patriotic citizens from all backgrounds all over we also have to be honest about the fact that not everyone who seeks to join our country will be able to successfully assimilate sometimes it just not going to work out it our right as a sovereign nation to chose immigrants that we think are the likeliest to thrive and flourish and love usthen there is the issue of security countless innocent american lives have been stolen because our politicians have failed in their duty to secure our borders and enforce our laws like they have to be enforced i have met with many of the great parents who lost their children to sanctuary cities and open borders so many people so many many people so sad they will be joining me on this stage in a little while and i look forward to introducing these are amazing amazing peoplecountless americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this administration and the administration that causes this horrible horrible thought process called hillary clintonthis includes incredible americans like 21 year old sarah root the man who killed her arrived at the border entered federal custody and then was released into the us think of it into the us community under the policies of the white house barack obama and hillary clinton weak weak policies weak and foolish policieshe was released again after the crime and now he out there at large sarah had graduated from college with a 40 top student in her class one day before her deathalso among the victims of the obamaclinton open borders policy was grant ronnebeck a 21yearold convenience store clerk and a really good guy from mesa arizona a lot of you have known about granthe was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary who had also been released from federal custody and they knew it was going to happen againanother victim is kate steinle gunned down in the sanctuary city of san francisco by an illegal immigrant deported five previous times and they knew he was no goodthen there is the case of 90yearold earl olander who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home 90 years old and defenseless the perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records a mile long who did not meet obama administration standards for removal and they knew it was going to happenin california a 64yearold air force veteran a great woman according to everybody that knew her marilyn pharis was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions but was never ever deported despite the fact that everybody wanted him outa 2011 report from the government accountability office found that illegal immigrants and other noncitizens in our prisons and jails together had around 25000 homicide arrests to their names 25000on top of that illegal immigration costs our country more than 113 billion dollars a yearand this is what we get for the money we are going to spend on illegal immigration over the next 10 years we could provide 1 million atrisk students with a school voucher which so many people are wantingwhile there are many illegal immigrants in our country who are good people many many this doesnt change the fact that most illegal immigrants are lower skilled workers with less education who compete directly against vulnerable american workers and that these illegal workers draw much more out from the system than they can ever possibly pay backand theyre hurting a lot of our people that cannot get jobs under any circumstancesbut these facts are never reported instead the media and my opponent discuss one thing and only one thing the needs of people living here illegally in many cases by the way theyre treated better than our vetsnot going to happen anymore folks november 8th not going to happen anymorethe truth is the central issue is not the needs of the 11 million illegal immigrants or however many there may be  and honestly weve been hearing that number for years it always 11 millionour government has no idea it could be 3 million it could be 30 million they have no idea what the number isfrankly our government has no idea what theyre doing on many many fronts folksbut whatever the number that never really been the central issue it will never be a central issue it doesnt matter from that standpoint anyone who tells you that the core issue is the needs of those living here illegally has simply spent too much time in washingtononly the out of touch media elites think the biggest problems facing america  you know this this is what they talk about facing american society today is that there are 11 million illegal immigrants who dont have legal status and they also think the biggest thing and you know this it not nuclear and it not isis it not russia it not china it global warmingto all the politicians donors and special interests hear these words from me and all of you today there is only one core issue in the immigration debate and that issue is the well being of the american peoplenothing even comes a close second hillary clinton for instance talks constantly about her fears that families will be separated but she not talking about the american families who have been permanently separated from their loved ones because of a preventable homicide because of a preventable death because of murderno she only talking about families who come here in violation of the law we will treat everyone living or residing in our country with great dignity so importantwe will be fair just and compassionate to all but our greatest compassion must be for our american citizensthank youpresident obama and hillary clinton have engaged in gross dereliction of duty by surrendering the safety of the american people to open borders and you know it better than anybody right here in arizona you know itpresident obama and hillary clinton support sanctuary cities they support catch and release on the border they support visa overstays they support the release of dangerous dangerous dangerous criminals from detention and they support unconstitutional executive amnestyhillary clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days and her plan will provide obamacare social security and medicare for illegal immigrants breaking the federal budgeton top of that she promises uncontrolled lowskilled immigration that continues to reduce jobs and wages for american workers and especially for africanamerican and hispanic workers within our country our citizensmost incredibly because to me this is unbelievable we have no idea who these people are where they come from i always say trojan horse watch what going to happen folks it not going to be prettythis includes her plan to bring in 620000 new refugees from syria and that region over a short period of time and even yesterday when you were watching the news you saw thousands and thousands of people coming in from syria what is wrong with our politicians our leaders if we can call them that what the hell are we doinghard to believe hard to believe now that youve heard about hillary clinton plan about which she has not answered a single question let me tell you about my planand do you notice and do you notice all the time for weeks and weeks of debating my plan debating talking about it what about this what about that they never even mentioned her plan on immigration because she doesnt want to get into the quagmire it a tough one she doesnt know what she doing except open borders and let everybody come in and destroy our country by the waywhile hillary clinton meets only with donors and lobbyists my plan was crafted with the input from federal immigration offices very great people among the top immigration experts anywhere in this country who represent workers not corporations very important to usi also worked with lawmakers whove led on this issue on behalf of american citizens for many years and most importantly ive met with the people directly impacted by these policies so importantnumber one are you ready are you readywe will build a great wall along the southern borderand mexico will pay for the wallone hundred percent they dont know it yet but theyre going to pay for it and theyre great people and great leaders but theyre going to pay for the wall on day one we will begin working on intangible physical tall power beautiful southern border wallwe will use the best technology including above and below ground sensors that the tunnels remember that above and belowabove and below ground sensors towers aerial surveillance and manpower to supplement the wall find and dislocate tunnels and keep out criminal cartels and mexico you know that will work with us i really believe it mexico will work with us i absolutely believe it and especially after meeting with their wonderful wonderful president today i really believe they want to solve this problem along with us and im sure they willnumber two we are going to end catch and release we catch them oh go ahead we catch them go aheadunder my administration anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed out of our country and back to the country from which they cameand theyll be brought great distances were not dropping them right across they learned that president eisenhower theyd drop them across right across and theyd come back and acrossthen when they flew them to a long distance all of a sudden that was the end we will take them great distances but we will take them to the country where they came from oknumber three number three this is the one i think it so great it hard to believe people dont even talk about it zero tolerance for criminal aliens zero zerozero they dont come in here they dont come in hereaccording to federal data there are at least 2 million 2 million think of it criminal aliens now inside of our country 2 million people criminal aliens we will begin moving them out day one as soon as i take office day one in joint operation with local state and federal law enforcementnow just so you understand the police who we all respect  say hello to the police boy they dont get the credit they deserve i can tell you theyre great people but the police and law enforcement they know who these people arethey live with these people they get mocked by these people they cant do anything about these people and they want to they know who these people are day one my first hour in office those people are goneand you can call it deported if you want the press doesnt like that term you can call it whatever the hell you want theyre gonebeyond the 2 million and there are vast numbers of additional criminal illegal immigrants who have fled but their days have run out in this country the crime will stop theyre going to be gone it will be overtheyre going out theyre going out fastmoving forward we will issue detainers for illegal immigrants who are arrested for any crime whatsoever and they will be placed into immediate removal proceedings if we even have to do thatwe will terminate the obama administration deadly and it is deadly nonenforcement policies that allow thousands of criminal aliens to freely roam our streets walk around do whatever they want to do crime all over the placethat over that over folks that oversince 2013 alone the obama administration has allowed 300000 criminal aliens to return back into united states communities these are individuals encountered or identified by ice but who were not detained or processed for deportation because it wouldnt have been politically correctmy plan also includes cooperating closely with local jurisdictions to remove criminal aliens immediately we will restore the highly successful secure communities program good program we will expand and revitalize the popular 287g partnerships which will help to identify hundreds of thousands of deportable aliens in local jails that we dont even know aboutboth of these programs have been recklessly gutted by this administration and those were programs that workedthis is yet one more area where we are headed in a totally opposite direction there no common sense there no brain power in our administration by our leader or our leaders none none nonehere an interesting graphic from a study published this summer on voting attitudes among people who heard incumbents use restrictive rhetoric on immigration  tough enforcement no amnesty deportations  and its affect on their own opinionson my first day in office i am also going to ask congress to pass kate law named for kate steinleto ensure that criminal aliens convicted of illegal reentry receive strong mandatory minimum sentences strongand then we get them outanother reform im proposing is the passage of legislation named for detective michael davis and deputy sheriff danny oliver to law enforcement officers recently killed by a previously deported illegal immigrantthe davisoliver bill will enhance cooperation with state and local authorities to ensure that criminal immigrants and terrorists are swiftly really swiftly identified and removed and they will go face believe me theyre going to gowere going to triple the number of ice deportation officerswithin ice i am going to create a new special deportation task force focused on identifying and quickly removing the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in america who have evaded justice just like hillary clinton has evaded justice okmaybe theyll be able to deport herthe local police who know every one of these criminals and they know each and every one by name by crime where they live they will work so fast and our local police will be so happy that they dont have to be abused by these thugs anymore there no great mystery to it theyve put up with it for years and no finally we will turn the tables and law enforcement and our police will be allowed to clear up this dangerous and threatening messwere also going to hire 5000 more border patrol agentswho gave me their endorsement 16500 gave me their endorsementand put more of them on the border instead of behind desks which is good we will expand the number of border patrol stations significantlyive had a chance to spend time with these incredible law enforcement officers and i want to take a moment to thank them what they do is incredibleand getting their endorsement means so much to me more to me really than i can say means so much first time theyve ever endorsed a presidential candidatenumber four block funding for sanctuary cities we block the funding no more fundswe will end the sanctuary cities that have resulted in so many needless deaths cities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities will not receive taxpayer dollars and we will work with congress to pass legislation to protect those jurisdictions that do assist federal authoritiesnumber five cancel unconstitutional executive orders and enforce all immigration lawswe will immediately terminate president obama two illegal executive amnesties in which he defied federal law and the constitution to give amnesty to approximately five million illegal immigrants five millionand how about all the millions that are waiting on line going through the process legally so unfairhillary clinton has pledged to keep both of these illegal amnesty programs including the 2014 amnesty which has been blocked by the united states supreme court greatclinton has also pledged to add a third executive amnesty and by the way folks she will be a disaster for our country a disaster in so many other waysand dont forget the supreme court of the united states dont forget that when you go to vote on november 8 and dont forget your second amendment and dont forget the repeal and replacement of obamacareand dont forget building up our depleted military and dont forget taking care of our vets dont forget our vets they have been forgottenclinton plan would trigger a constitutional crisis unlike almost anything we have ever seen before in effect she would be abolishing the lawmaking powers of congress in order to write her own laws from the oval office and you see what bad judgment she has she has seriously bad judgmentcan you imagine in a trump administration all immigration laws will be enforced will be enforced as with any law enforcement activity we will set priorities but unlike this administration no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement and ice and border patrol officers will be allowed to do their jobs the way their jobs are supposed to be doneanyone who has entered the united states illegally is subject to deportation that is what it means to have laws and to have a country otherwise we dont have a countryour enforcement priorities will include removing criminals gang members security threats visa overstays public charges that is those relying on public welfare or straining the safety net along with millions of recent illegal arrivals and overstays whove come here under this current corrupt administrationnumber six we are going to suspend the issuance of visas to any place where adequate screening cannot occuraccording to data provided by the senate subcommittee on immigration and the national interest between 9/11 and the end of 2014 at least 380 foreign born individuals were convicted in terror cases inside the united states and even right now the largest number of people are under investigation for exactly this that weve ever had in the history of our countryour country is a mess we dont even know what to look for anymore folks our country has to straighten out and we have to straighten out fastthe number is likely higher but the administration refuses to provide this information even to congress as soon as i enter office i am going to ask the department of state which has been brutalized by hillary clinton brutalizedhomeland security and the department of justice to begin a comprehensive review of these cases in order to develop a list of regions and countries from which immigration must be suspended until proven and effective vetting mechanisms can be put in placei call it extreme vetting right extreme vetting i want extreme it going to be so tough and if somebody comes in that fine but theyre going to be good it extremeand if people dont like it weve got have a country folks got to have a country countries in which immigration will be suspended would include places like syria and libya and we are going to stop the tens of thousands of people coming in from syriawe have no idea who they are where they come from there no documentation there no paperwork it going to end badly folks it going to end very very badlyfor the price of resettling one refugee in the united states 12 could be resettled in a safe zone in their home region which i agree with 100 percent we have to build safe zones and well get the money from gulf states we dont want to put up the money we owe almost 20 trillion doubled since obama took office our national debtbut we will get the money from gulf states and others well supervise it well build safe zones which is something that i think all of us want to seeanother reform involves new screening tests for all applicants that include and this is so important especially if you get the right people and we will get the right people an ideological certification to make sure that those we are admitting to our country share our values and love our peoplethank you were very proud of our country arent we really with all it going through were very proud of our country for instance in the last five years weve admitted nearly 100000 immigrants from iraq and afghanistan and these two countries according to pew research a majority of residents say that the barbaric practice of honor killings against women are often or sometimes justified that what they saythat what they say theyre justified right and were admitting them to our country applicants will be asked their views about honor killings about respect for women and gays and minorities attitudes on radical islam which our president refuses to say and many other topics as part of this vetting procedure and if we have the right people doing it believe me very very few will slip through the cracks hopefully nonenumber seven we will insure that other countries take their people back when they order them deportedthere are at least 23 countries that refuse to take their people back after theyve been ordered to leave the united states including large numbers of violent criminals they wont take them back so we say ok well keep them not going to happen with me not going to happen with medue to a supreme court decision if these violent offenders cannot be sent home our law enforcement officers have to release them into your communitiesand by the way the results are horrific horrific there are often terrible consequences such as casey chadwick tragic death in connecticut just last year yet despite the existence of a law that commands the secretary of state to stop issuing visas to these countriessecretary hillary clinton ignored this law and refused to use this powerful tool to bring nations into compliance and they would comply if we would act properlyin other words if we had leaders that knew what they were doing which we dontthe result of her misconduct was the release of thousands and thousands of dangerous criminal aliens who should have been sent home to their countries instead we have them all over the place probably a couple in this room as a matter of fact but i hope notaccording to a report for the boston globe from the year 2008 to 2014 nearly 13000 criminal aliens were released back into us communities because their home countries would not under any circumstances take them back hard to believe with the power we have hard to believewere like the big bully that keeps getting beat up you ever see that the big bully that keeps getting beat upthese 13000 release occurred on hillary clinton watch she had the power and the duty to stop it cold and she decided she would not do itand arizona knows better than most exactly what im talking aboutapplausethose released include individuals convicted of killings sexual assaults and some of the most heinous crimes imaginablethe boston globe writes that a globe review of 323 criminals released in new england from 2008 to 2012 found that as many as 30 percent committed new offenses including rape attempted murder and child molestation we take them we take themnumber eight we will finally complete the biometric entryexit visa tracking system which we need desperately for years congress has required biometric entryexit visa tracking systems but it has never been completed the politicians are all talk no action never happens never happenshillary clinton all talk unfortunately when there is action it always the wrong decision you ever notice in my administration we will ensure that this system is in place and i will tell you it will be on land it will be on sea it will be in air we will have a proper tracking systemapproximately half of new illegal immigrants came on temporary visas and then never ever left why should the nobody telling them to leave stay as long as you want well take care of youbeyond violating our laws visa overstays pose  and they really are a big problem pose a substantial threat to national security the 9/11 commission said that this tracking system would be a high priority and would have assisted law enforcement and intelligence officials in august and september in 2001 in conducting a search for two of the 9/11 hijackers that were in the united states expired visasand you know what that would have meant what that could have meant wouldnt that have been wonderful right what that could have meantlast year alone nearly half a million individuals overstayed their temporary visas removing these overstays will be a top priority of my administrationif people around the world believe they can just come on a temporary visa and never ever leave the obamaclinton policy that what it is then we have a completely open border and we no longer have a countrywe must send a message that visa expiration dates will be strongly enforcednumber nine we will turn off the jobs and benefits magnetwe will ensure that everify is used to the fullest extent possible under existing law and we will work with congress to strengthen and expand its use across the countryimmigration law doesnt exist for the purpose of keeping criminals out it exists to protect all aspects of american life the work site the welfare office the education system and everything elsethat is why immigration limits are established in the first place if we only enforced the laws against crime then we have an open border to the entire world we will enforce all of our immigration lawsand the same goes for government benefits the center for immigration studies estimates that 62 percent of households headed by illegal immigrants use some form of cash or noncash welfare programs like food stamps or housing assistancetremendous costs by the way to our country tremendous costs this directly violates the federal public charge law designed to protect the united states treasury those who abuse our welfare system will be priorities for immediate removalnumber 10 we will reform legal immigration to serve the best interests of america and its workers the forgotten people workers were going to take care of our workersand by the way and by the way were going to make great trade deals were going to renegotiate trade deals were going to bring our jobs back home were going to bring our jobs back homewe have the most incompetently worked trade deals ever negotiated probably in the history of the world and that starts with nafta and now they want to go tpp one of the great disasterswere going to bring our jobs back home and if companies want to leave arizona and if they want to leave other states there going to be a lot of trouble for them it not going to be so easy there will be consequence remember that there will be consequence theyre not going to be leaving go to another country make the product sell it into the united states and all we end up with is no taxes and total unemployment it not going to happen there will be consequencesweve admitted 59 million immigrants to the united states between 1965 and 2015 many of these arrivals have greatly enriched our country so true but we now have an obligation to them and to their children to control future immigration as we are following if you think previous immigration wavesweve had some big waves and tremendously positive things have happened incredible things have happened to ensure assimilation we want to ensure that it works assimilation an important word integration and upward mobilitywithin just a few years immigration as a share of national population is set to break all historical records the time has come for a new immigration commission to develop a new set of reforms to our legal immigration system in order to achieve the following goalsto keep immigration levels measured by population share within historical norms to select immigrants based on their likelihood of success in us society and their ability to be financially self sufficientwe take anybody come on in anybody just come on in not anymoreyou know folks it called a twoway street it is a twoway street right we need a system that serves our needs not the needs of others remember under a trump administration it called america first remember thatto choose immigrants based on merit merit skill and proficiency doesnt that sound nice and to establish new immigration controls to boost wages and to ensure that open jobs are offered to american workers first and that in particular african american and latino workers who are being shut out in this process so unfairlyand hillary clinton is going to do nothing for the african american worker the latino worker she going to do nothing give me your vote she says on november eighth and then shell say so long see you in four years that what it isshe is going to do nothing and just look at the past she done nothing she been there for 35 years she done nothing and i say what do you have to lose choose me watch how good were going to do together watchyou watch we want people to come into our country but they have to come into our country legally and properly vetted and in a manner that serves the national interest weve been living under outdated immigration rules from decades ago theyre decades and decades oldto avoid this happening in the future i believe we should sunset our visa laws so that congress is forced to periodically revise and revisit them to bring them up to date theyre archaic theyre ancient we wouldnt put our entire federal budget on auto pilot for decades so why should we do the same for the very very complex subject of immigrationso let now talk about the big picture these 10 steps if rigorously followed and enforced will accomplish more in a matter of months than our politicians have accomplished on this issue in the last 50 years it going to happen folks because i am proudly not a politician because i am not behold to any special interest ive spent a lot of money on my campaign ill tell you i write those checks nobody owns trumpi will get this done for you and for your family well do it right youll be proud of our country again well do it right we will accomplish all of the steps outlined above and when we do peace and law and justice and prosperity will prevail crime will go down border crossings will plummet gangs will disappearand the gangs are all over the place and welfare use will decrease we will have a peace dividend to spend on rebuilding america beginning with our american inner cities were going to rebuild them for once and for allfor those here illegally today who are seeking legal status they will have one route and one route only to return home and apply for reentry like everybody else under the rules of the new legal immigration system that i have outlined above those who have left to seek entry thank you thank you those who have left to seek entry under this new system  and it will be an efficient system  will not be awarded surplus visas but will have to apply for entry under the immigration caps or limits that will be established in the futurewe will break the cycle of amnesty and illegal immigration we will break the cycle there will be no amnestyour message to the world will be this you cannot obtain legal status or become a citizen of the united states by illegally entering our country cant do itthis declaration alone will help stop the crisis of illegal crossings and illegal overstays very importantly people will know that you cant just smuggle in hunker down and wait to be legalized it not going to work that way those days are overimportantly in several years when we have accomplished all of our enforcement and deportation goals and truly ended illegal immigration for good including the construction of a great wall which we will have built in record time and at a reasonable cost which you never hear from the governmentand the establishment of our new lawful immigration system then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those individuals who remainthat discussion can take place only in an atmosphere in which illegal immigration is a memory of the past no longer with us allowing us to weigh the different options available based on the new circumstances at the timeright now however were in the middle of a jobs crisis a border crisis and a terrorism crisis like never before all energies of the federal government and the legislative process must now be focused on immigration security that is the only conversation we should be having at this time immigration security cut it offwhether it dangerous materials being smuggled across the border terrorists entering on visas or americans losing their jobs to foreign workers these are the problems we must now focus on fixing and the media needs to begin demanding to hear hillary clinton answer on how her policies will affect americans and their securitythese are matters of life and death for our country and its people and we deserve answers from hillary clinton and do you notice she doesnt answershe didnt go to louisiana she didnt go to mexico she was invitedshe doesnt have the strength or the stamina to make america great again believe mewhat we do know despite the lack of media curiosity is that hillary clinton promises a radical amnesty combined with a radical reduction in immigration enforcement just ask the border patrol about hillary clinton you wont like what youre hearingthe result will be millions more illegal immigrants thousands of more

will stop the madness of obamacareevery single one of arizona 15 counties is losing insurers next year because of obamacare in phoenix there are 8 obamacare insurers this year next year there will be only one and it was announced this week that obamacare premiums in phoenix will go up 145 next year one insurer in the state will have a 14000 deductibleobamacare is a catastrophe for arizona and a catastrophe for all of americaeven bill clinton admitted obamacare is the craziest thing in the world where people wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in halfin minnesota where the premium increase will be close to 60 percent the democratic governor has said the affordable care act is no longer affordablejonathan gruber the architect of obamacare admitted it was all a fraud and he said outrageously that it was passed because of the stupidity of the american voterhillary clinton wants to doubledown on obamacare making it even more expensivemy contract with the american voter outlines a plan to repeal and replace obamacare and im asking for your vote so we can save healthcare for every family in arizonareal change also means getting rid of the corruption in washingtonas you have heard it was just announced yesterday that the fbi is reopening their investigation into the criminal and illegal conduct of hillary clintonthis is the biggest political scandal since watergate and it is everybody deepest hope that justice at last can be deliveredhillary has nobody but herself to blame for her mounting legal troubles her criminal action was willful deliberate intentional and purposefulhillary setup an illegal server for the obvious purpose of shielding her criminal conduct from public disclosure  and exposureshe setup this illegal server knowing full well that her actions put our national security at risk and put the safety and security of your children at risk but she didnt care  as long as she and bill got the money the safety of your family didnt matterto coverup her crimes she bleached and deleted 33000 emails after receiving a congressional subpoena made 13 phones disappear  some with a hammer lied to congress under oath lied to the fbi many times and then two boxes of email evidence went mysteriously missingthe wikileaks revelations have exposed criminal corruption at the highest levels of our governmenthillary put the office of secretary of state up for sale and if she ever got the chance shed put the oval office up for sale too shed put it up for sale to special interests and foreign dictators  whoever offers the highest priceyet now it reported that the department of justice is fighting the fbi  that because the department of justice is trying to protect hillary clinton97 of department of justice employee presidential contributions went to hillary clintonthere are those and i happen to be one of them who think hillary offered lorretta lynch a reappointment as attorney general if she were to become president perhaps that was what bill clinton was arranging when he met with attorney general lynch on her airplane on the tarmac right here in arizonathis is what we mean when we say the system is riggeda vote for hillary is a vote to surrender our government to public corruption graft and cronyism that threatens the survival of our constitutional system itselfwhat makes us exceptional is that we are a nation of laws and that we are all equal under those laws  hillary corruption shreds the principle on which our nation was foundedgovernment corruption spreads outward like a cancer infecting the whole operation of our governmentwhen the outcome is fixed when the system is rigged people lose hope  they stop dreaming they stop tryingwhen the powerful can get away with anything because they have the money and the connections to rig the system then people lose confidence in our laws and in our futurehillary corruption is corrosive to the soul of our nation and it must be stoppedas fdr once said government by organized money is just as dangerous as government by organized mobhillary believes money and power  not truth and justice  should rule the daywe have one ultimate check on

53,good morning thank you christine for that kind introductioni also want to thank the marcellus shale coalition the ohio oil and gas association and the west virginia oil and natural gas association for inviting me to join you here today your organizations represent tens of thousands of jobs for hardworking americanslet me also recognize my friend harold hammit is great to be here in pittsburgh the steel city under a trump administration we are going to bring back our steel jobs and we are going to rebuild this nationbefore going any further today i want to address the turmoil unfolding right now in our countryour country desperately needs unity and it needs the spirit of togetherness that has not only got us through our toughest times  but which has lifted us up in the past to our greatest achievements as a nation every day i see people of different backgrounds working together for a common good and we need to bring that spirit to every part of our country  and become one american nation united by our shared values and principles as american citizenswe all have to walk a mile in someone else shoes see things through their eyes and then get to work fixing our wounded countrymany americans are watching the unrest in charlotte unfolding on their tv screens others are witnessing the chaos and the violence firsthandour country looks bad to the world especially when we are supposed to be the leader how can we lead when we cant even control our own citieswe honor and recognize the right of all americans to peacefully assemble protest and demonstrate but there is no right to engage in violent disruption or to threaten the public safety and peaceevery single american in this country is entitled to live in a safe community the violence against our citizens and our law enforcement must be brought to an endthe people who will suffer the most as a result of these riots are lawabiding africanamerican residents who live in these communities it is their jobs housing markets schools and economic conditions that will suffer  and the first duty of government is to protect their wellbeing and safetythere is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct crime and violence is an attack on the poor and will never be accepted in a trump administrationour job is not to make life more comfortable for the violent disruptor but to make life more comfortable for the africanamerican parent trying to raise their kids in peacefor every one violent protestor there are thousands of moms and dads and kids in that same community who just want to be able to sleep safely at nightmore law enforcement more community engagement more effective policing is what our country needslast year we saw a 17 rise in violent crime in our fifty largest cities homicides are up nearly 50 in washington dc and more than 60 in baltimoremore than 3000 have been shot in chicago so far this year alonenationwide approximately 60 of murder victims under the age of 22 are africanamericanthis is a national crisis and it is the job of the next president to work with our governors and mayors to address this crisis and save africanamerican liveslook at the example of mayor rudy giuliani in new york the policies he put into place ultimately brought down crime by 76 percent and murder by 84 percent think of how many families these policies saved from the worst heartache imaginablewe need a national anticrime agenda to make our cities safe againi will appoint the best prosecutors investigators and federal law enforcement officers in the country to dismantle the international cartels gangs and criminal syndicates  and i will stop the drugs from flowing into our countrymy administration will work with local communities and local officials to make the reduction of crime a top prioritysafety is the foundation of the ladder to american success a great education and a goodpaying job to have the best schools and the best jobs you must have safe communitiesthat means we must recognize the contributions of our police who come from all backgrounds and all walks of life and who often thanklessly risk their own lives to protect the innocentwe all remember earlier this year when officers in dallas  hunted down for execution  continued protecting the public until their last moments on earthevery day police officers risk their lives for complete strangers and every year many of them will go out on calls and never returnpolice are entrusted with immense responsibility and we must do everything we can to ensure they are properly trained that they respect all members of the public and that any wrongdoing is always vigorously addressedbut our men and women in blue also need our support our thanks and our gratitude they are the line separating civilization from total chaosthey are also the front lines of defense in the war on terror as we saw recently with their quick action following the terrorist attacks in new jersey and new york and the offduty police officer heroic actions in minnesotain addition to providing safety we must provide economic opportunity that begins with school choice and leads to a secure job with a rising incomethis brings us to the subject of energyproducing more american energy is a central part of my plan to making america wealthy again  especially for the poorest americansamerica is sitting on a treasure trove of untapped energy  some 50 trillion dollars in shale energy oil reserves and natural gas on federal lands in addition to hundreds of years of coal energy reservesit all upside more jobs more revenues more wealth higher wages and lower energy pricesi am going to lift the restrictions on american energy and allow this wealth to pour into our communities  including right here in pennsylvaniaaccording to the institute for energy research lifting the restrictions on american energy including shale production will accomplish the followingincrease gdp by more than 100 billion annuallyadd over 500000 new jobs annuallyincrease annual wages by more than 30 billion over the next 7 yearsincrease federal state and local tax revenues by almost 6 trillion over 4 decadesincrease total economic activity by more than 20 trillion over the next 40 yearsin addition we will streamline the permitting process for all energy infrastructure projects including the billions of dollars in projects held up by president obama  creating countless more jobs in the processoverall my entire economic plan  tax reform regulatory reform energy reform and trade reform  will create at least 25 million new jobs over the next 10 years assuming an average growth rate of 35 percent and i believe we will reach 4 growthmy tax plan includes a fifteen percent business tax rate for small and large businesses down from 35 percent today  turning america into a jobs magnet hillary clinton would raise taxes on some small businesses to as high as 45 percentincome taxes will be simplified from 7 brackets to 3 and middle class americans will get a major tax cut  including childcare deductions and taxfree childcare savings accountsmy plan includes the elimination of all unnecessary regulations and a temporary moratorium on new regulations not compelled by congress or public safety overregulation is costing our economy 2 trillion a yearon energy my economic plan unlocks our shale oil and gas and the energy technologies of both today and tomorrowfinally my plan includes a renegotiation of america trade deals and the enforcement of trade rules to increase jobs and wealth inside the united states strong border controls will also protect our workers and save our budget trillions in the longtermit is perhaps the most progrowth economic plan in american historycompare that to my opponent she plans a 13 trillion tax hike massive new regulations the offshoring of american jobs and the aggressive restriction of american energy production her plan will help only her wealthy donors and global special interests who benefit from the rigged systemhillary clinton wants to put the coal miners out of work ban hydraulic fracturing in most places and extensively restrict and ban energy production on public lands and in most offshore areasthis will produce devastation for states like pennsylvania ohio and west virginia where shale energy and coal production are critical parts of the economyher plan hurts states like colorado florida virginia north carolina and any anywhere with access to either onshore or offshore energy resourcesshe also supports blocking the energy infrastructure that is needed to move our energy resources to the marketplaceaccording to the wall street journal overall more than a dozen  projects worth about 33 billion have been either rejected by regulators or withdrawn by developers since 2012 with billions more tied up in projects still in regulatory limboexamples of energy transportation projects blocked or abandoned include an 850 million coal export facility in washington a 3 billion natural gas pipeline in the northeast and a 68 billion liquid natural gas export facility among othersbillions of dollars in private infrastructure investment have been lost to the obamaclinton restriction agendathe platform produced by hillary clinton party this year also calls for a price on carbon that just politicalspeak for a massive new tax on coal and shale production  a tax on american consumersand remember every energy dollar that isnt harvested here in america is harvested instead in a foreign country  often foreign countries not very friendly to usthat not only means we are sending our jobs to those countries but it means energy is being produced in foreign countries that lack our high environmental and conservation standardsthat is just one more reason why we should pursue the safe and responsible production of america vast energy reserveswe need an americafirst energy planthis means opening federal lands for oil and gas production opening offshore areas and revoking policies that are imposing unnecessary restrictions on innovative new exploration technologiesthe development of the marcellus and utica shales will fundamentally change the economic landscape of this region and our country bringing extraordinary new prosperity to millions  more jobs higher wages a larger tax base and dollars flowing into our country for a change instead of out of our countryhillary clinton war on energy will cost our economy 5 trillion dollarsshe has not only declared war on the miners but on oil and natural gas production  which supports 10 million jobs in the united statesaccess to lowcost liquid natural gas also supports the american chemical industry which supports 40000 jobs in pennsylvaniawe have just begun as a nation to recognize our economic advantage that is made possible by shale energy the shale energy revolution will unleash massive wealth for american workers and familiesat the same time this energy revolution will produce new demand for american steelbut federal restrictions remain a major impediment to both shale production specifically and energy production in generalcurrently less than 10 percent of the federally managed surface and mineral estates are leased for oil and gas developmentalmost 90 of our nation offshore acreage is offlimits to energy productionour energy policy will make full use of our domestic energy sources including traditional and renewable energy sourcesthat means we will end the war on coali will rescind the coal mining lease moratorium the excessive interior department stream rule and conduct a topdown review of all anticoal regulations issued by the obama administrationwe will eliminate the highlyinvasive waters of the us rule and scrap the 5 trillion dollar obamaclinton climate action plan and the clean power plan  these unilateral plans will increase monthly electric bills by doubledigits without any measurable improvement in climatei will refocus the epa on its core mission of ensuring clean air and clean safe drinking water for all americansi believe firmly in conserving our wonderful natural resources and beautiful natural habitats my environmental agenda will be guided by true specialists in conservation not those with radical political agendasit will be a future of conservation of prosperity and of great successit will be a future of new technology new innovation and new solutionsit will be a future we can achieve together beginning with a victory on november 8thwe will make america wealthy againwe will make america safe againand we will make america great again

allowing hillary clinton to get away with her terrible crimes  and i guarantee you the clintons are laughing at them the director performance in congress coupled with bill clinton clandestine meeting on the tarmac in the attorney general airplane just prior to decisiontime on hillary  supposedly talking about golf and grandchildren  is perhaps the lowest point in those department historyinstead of being held accountable hillary is running for president in what looks like a rigged election the election is being rigged by corrupt media pushing false allegations and outright lies in an effort to

businessesmy economic agenda is very simple jobs jobs jobsi want to send our best wishes to the great governor mike pence as he prepares for his debate tonight the debate will be a contrast between our campaign of big ideas and bold solutions for tomorrow versus the small and petty clinton campaign that is stuck in the past we are change  she is four more years of obamaclinton cant talk about the real problems facing our country because she the one who helped create all of our problems in the first place to hide her corruption she deleted 33000 emails after a congressional subpoenahillary clinton has been there for 30 years and hasnt fixed anything in fact she just made things worse  she failed upstate new york promising to create 200000 jobs but manufacturing is down almost 40 percent she failed overseas unleashing death and destruction and she failed latinos and africanamericans producing only more poverty in the inner citiesnow after years of failure she complains about how ive used the tax laws to my benefit then why didnt she ever try to change those laws so i could not have used them the way i did she could have changed those laws when she was in the senate the reason that she did not is that her donors and contributors have used those tax laws the same as i didi know all their names and i know who they are but it not up to me to make them public figurestwo public hillary supporters who are known are george soros who declared losses of 15 billion in just six months and warren buffet who in 2014 declared losses of 873 millioni know how the tax code works better than anyone and i am going to fix it so it is fair and just and works for you and your familyive made my money as a highlysuccessful private businessperson following the law hillary clinton made her money as a corrupt public official violating the law and selling her government officethe problems we face as a country are immense and it is going to take bold action to turn things aroundright now we owe 20 trillion in debt it doubled under president obamaour infrastructure is like that of a thirdworld countrythe homicide rate last year experienced its largest singleyear increase in 45 yearsour border is wide open and drugs and criminal cartels our pouring into the countrythousands of refugees are being admitted with no way to screen them and are instantly made eligible for welfare and free healthcare  even as our own veterans die waiting for the medical care they needour annual trade deficit with the world is nearly 800 billion a yearthe federal budget is a disaster our state department mostly under the watch of hillary clinton misplaced or lost 6 billion in taxpayer fundswe have the worst socalled recovery since the great depressionwe are nation divided with race riots in the streetsour college students graduate loaded with debt only to discover they cant find jobs  or certainly not the jobs they wantoverseas our failed leaders have empowered iran unleashed isis and turned iraq libya and syria into absolute chaosour allies arent paying their fair share foreign countries like russia and china do not respect us and our taxpaying citizens send troops and foreign aid all over the world even as their own cities cant provide the most basic servicesamerica needs a turnaroundamerica needs a comebackamerica needs a changethat is why i am runningfirst we are going to repeal and replace obamacarethe architect of obamacare jonathan gruber admitted that the whole sales pitch was a lie  he called it the stupidity of the american voter but the only stupidity was the stupidity of our leaders who passed this disaster into law over the objections of the american peopledo you remember all the lies president obama said if you like your doctor you can keep your doctorhe promised his plan would reduce premiums by 2500 dollars instead they surged 5000now of all people president bill clinton has come out and told the truth about obamacarehe has absolutely trashed president obama signature legislation remember hillary clinton called obamacare one of the greatest accomplishments of president obama of the democratic party of our countrybill has a different view here is what bill saidhe just said it a crazy system where people end up with premiums doubled and coverage cut in half he said it the craziest thing in the worldbill clinton saidpeople out there  busting it sometimes 60 hours a week  wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half  the people getting killed in this deal are the small business people and the individuals who make just a bit too much money to get any of these subsidies clinton added that it doesnt make any sense and that the insurance model doesnt worki couldnt agree more which is why on my first day in office i am going to ask a republican congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace obamacarethis is essential for arizona because of obamacare most of the state will only have 1 carrier next year and premiums are expected to go up by 49 next yearthere is only 1 way to stop it to vote for trump early ballots are mailed out on october 12th and you need to mail them back in as early as you possibly

56,this is such an amazing city it called home of the heroes because of your proud tradition of military service pueblo is home to four medal of honor recipients as president eisenhower said there must be something in the water out there in pueblo because all you guys turn out to be heroescolorado is home to six military bases we are going to eliminate the defense sequester and rebuild our militaryanother great colorado legacy is hunting and fishing we are going to conserve your land for future generations and we are going to save the 2nd amendmentone other issue of such great importance in colorado is energy hillary clinton wants to shut down the mines and shut down shale oil and natural gas we are going to end the war on american energy and we are going to put the miners back to worki have also made a center piece of my economic revitalization plan the largest middle class tax cut since ronald reagan and the largest regulatory reform in american history that is because i know how overtaxed and overregulated the working people of this country area central issue i would like to address today is our broken tax code an issue of concern to all americansalong with securing our borders rebuilding our military keeping us safe from terrorism redoing our trade deals and bringing back jobs fixing the tax code is one of the main reasons im running for presidentive been saying from the beginning of this campaign how ridiculous complex and yes unfair our tax system is this is not the fault of the irs but the political class that is owned outright by the special interests and lobbyistsit is these politicians who wrote the tax code and who are constantly adding revising and changing an already overcomplicated set of laws  all at the behest of their favored donors and special interestsit thousands of pages long and almost no one understands it the average american would need an army of accountants and lawyers to wade their way through itmany socalled experts due to the sheer size and complexity of the code dont have a clue what these pages representthe unfairness of the tax laws is unbelievable it something ive been talking about for a long time  despite being a beneficiaryi understand the tax laws better than almost anyone which is why i am the one who can fix them  and that is what i commit to doingas a businessman and real estate developer i have legally used the tax laws to my benefit and to the benefit of my company and my employeesi have often said on the campaign trail that i have a fiduciary responsibility to pay no more tax than legally required  or put another way to pay as little tax as legally possibleas a major real estate developer in this country and throughout the world i face enormous taxes city taxes state taxes sales and excise taxes employee taxes and federal taxes it my job to minimize the overall tax burden to the greatest extent possible  which allows me to reinvest in neighborhoods workers and build amazing properties which fuel tremendous growth in their communities  and always help our great providers of jobs the small businessthe news media is now obsessed with an alleged tax filing from the 1990 at the end of one of the most brutal economic downturns in our country historythe conditions facing real estate developers in the early nineties were almost as bad as the great depression of 1929 and far worse than the great recession of 2008what had been a booming economy in the era of ronald reagan changed dramatically  and the business landscape changed with it bank failures the collapse of the savings & loan industry and the implosion of the retail market and real estate in generalmany business people including many of my competitors were not able to survive companies jobs and opportunities were lost  and lives were destroyed as tens of thousands of people were put out of work some of the biggest and strongest people and companies went bankruptyet today my company is bigger stronger with far greater assets and more premium properties than ever beforethat did not happen by chance or luck  it happened by action and talenti was able to use the tax laws of this country and my business acumen to dig out of this real estate depression when few others did in those most difficult times when so many had their backs to the wall i reached within myself and delivered for my company my employees my family and the communities where my properties existedthose who spend their entire lives within the confines of government work and who know virtually nothing of business fail to understand the skill dedication and sheer grit it takes for a company to climb out of an economic depression of the scale we had in the early nineties people like my opponent hillary clinton whose only method of making money is by sellinggovernment favors and granting access to special interests know nothing about how businesses succeed and grow hillary clinton has never created a single job in her entire life  or added a single dollar of value to the american economy hillary clinton hasnt made an honest dollar in her entire life  all she does is take from you from our country and peddles influence to donors special interests and foreign actors  for astronomical dollars and like never before it corruption of the highest orderwhile i made my money as a highlysuccessful private businessman following the law hillary clinton made her money as a corrupt public official breaking the law and putting her government office up for saleby her own account hillary clinton left the white house dead broke and now she and her husband have made more than 200 million dollars  without building a company or creating a single thing of valueduring the early nineties as companies were collapsing left and right the media and powers that be said donald trump could never make it back they said i had billions of dollars in borrowing and hundreds of millions in personal guarantees and no pathway outbut i never had any doubts and never gave upthat because i knew in my heart that when the chips are down is when i perform at my very best and when people make the mistake of underestimating me that when they are in for their biggest surprisejust look at what happened in the primary just look at what our incredible movement is doing right nowthe reason i never felt endangered during the real estate downturn was that i knew myself i knew my business i knew the financial system i knew the tax code and most importantly i knew how to fight that what i am  a fighter and i am now going to fight for youwith my knowledge i knew that i would make a comeback in businessthat is why i am here today that is why i have left private business for public life  because i understand our country is in very bad shape and now our country is in need of a major comeback  it needs one now more than everwe owe 20 trillion dollars in debt but that only part of the story  we have over 100 trillion dollars in unfunded liabilities and we have a budget that out of control with annual deficits in addition because of the incompetence of our leaders we run massive trade deficits on an annual basis now almost 800 billion a yearour country is brokewe have decaying infrastructure failing schools rising crime a depleted military an open border and an economy that cant create fulltime highpaying jobs we are a divided nation and each week it seems we are getting more and more divided with race riots in our streets on a monthly basisthis is not the america that was handed down to us and it not the america we want for our children and it certainly not the america we want to pass down to our grandchildren but this is the america we will have if we dont turn things around  starting todaywhat i say is not lost on the american people because 70 of you believe our country is headed in the wrong directionwe cannot have another 4 years of barack obama and hillary clinton will be worsewe can turn this all around  but not if we dont make a change in leadership right now the failed political establishment must go  it must go for the sake of your country your future and those you love the mostin the early 90 they splashed the front pages with stories about how i was finished everybody said that i was done  there were front page articles in the wall street journal and new york times they were thrilled and delighted to write these negative storiesso they said i was finished the only person who didnt think that i was in trouble was donald trumpi started my company with a small loan and as i grew i borrowed money to grow the company when the bottom fell out of the real estate market i had all the debt it stayed the same  but the value of the assets plummeted but i knew how to use the tax code to rebuild my company when others did notmy understanding of the tax code gave me a big advantage over those who didnt have a clue including many of my competitors who lost everything they had never to be heard from againnow theyre gone and im here and im ready to turn things around for this countrythe early 90 was a very tough time for the world but in tough times you need tough peoplethese are tough times for america today and we need tough leaders not people who tell you what you want to hear but people who tell you what you need to hear we must never allow corrupt career politicians like the clintons ever back into the white house againthese tough times were when i performed my very best the economy and banks collapsing the government was a mess  but i enjoyed waking up every day to go to battle i enjoyed getting up every morning to take on the financial establishment on behalf of my company and win that the thinking we need for our country  that the thinking we need when we are negotiating trade deals and military deals and economic deals on behalf of the american peopleput me into the boardroom as your representative and i will deliver for you hillary clinton is in it only for herself and her donors i am here fighting for americamany people have said that i perform better under pressure than anyone theyve ever seen  ive proven that over and over againthat what i do when the pressure is on when the odds are stacked against me when people say it cant be done  that when i am just getting startedthe thing that motivates me the most is when people tell me something is impossible for me impossible is just a starting pointfrom the depths of that terrible real estate depression i created a company worth billions and billions of dollars and created tens of thousands of jobs our company and our employees remade skylines revitalized neighborhoods rejuvenated communities and hired thousands of workerson november 8th america comeback begins  and we are going to rise up from our present challenges bigger and better and stronger than ever beforethe people here in pueblo know what it takes to rebuild this countrythis is a city with a rich immigrant history and a rich latino history that has contributed so much to this country and this state though the people of pueblo and their families have hailed from all regions of the world you are united by this one thing you are all americansand as americans you are entitled to the same protections as every other american everyone lawfully living inside of our borders are entitled to the same things safe communities a great education and access to highpaying jobsthis is the change i will deliver hillary clinton has been there for 30 years and delivered nothing but failure her policies have brought death and destruction overseas and poverty at home she brought massive poverty for everyone but especially africanamerican and hispanic citizensshe opposes school choice and wants to trap poor africanamerican and hispanic children in failing government schools we are going to get poor minority children out of failing schools and into the public private charter or magnet school of their choicehillary clinton supports obamacare and wants to expand it  obamacare is an absolute disaster premiums in colorado are set to go up another 20 percent  the only way to stop this disaster is to vote trumphillary clinton also supports the terrible trade deals like bill clinton nafta and china entry into the world trade organization  and next she wants the transpacific partnership the deal she calls the gold standardcolorado has lost more than 1 in 7 manufacturing jobs since the nafta and china dealsbut while youve lost out hillary clinton has raked in cash from her contributors she and bill have made 150 million in speeches to special interests they gave 39 speeches to big banks including 2 million in speaking fees from goldman sachs the clintons received another 2 million from a swiss bank after hillary negotiated a favorable settlement for them as secretary of stateto hide her corruption hillary clinton put her emails on an illegal secret server open to foreign hacking then she deleted and bleached 33000 emails  after a congressional subpoena  to hide them from the public she lies to congress under oath and her ringleaders took the fifth amendment and got immunity deals it worse than watergatethe investigation of hillary clinton was rigged and it a shame and it one of the saddest things that have ever taken place in our nationwe have become a banana republicnow today we learned that the fbi made a side deal with clinton top aides to destroy their laptopslet me repeat that the fbi reportedly made a deal to destroy the

american people have one chance to stop it  by showing up and voting on november 8thpeople have had it with the years the decades of clinton corruptionthis is the year the american people say enough is enoughthe clintons are the sordid past we are the bright futurenow another issue i want to address today is immigration as i mentioned pueblo is filled with wonderful hardworking immigrants it is these hardworking immigrants who stand to lose the most from our open borders immigration policyillegal immigration and broken visa programs take jobs directly from hispanic workers living here lawfully todayillegal immigration also brings with it massive crime and massive drugs  including a terrible heroin problem right here in coloradowe are going to build a border wall and we are going to stop the drugs gangs and the violence from pouring into coloradowe are going to shut down the sanctuary cities that have led to the preventable deaths of so manycases like kate steinle murdered in san

over 2 million criminal aliens in this county and we are going to get them out  and we are going to get them out quicklyto the cartels the gangs the drug dealers i have a simple message for you your

office to the highest bidder and then to cover her tracksshe deleted 33000 emails after receiving a congressional subpoena nothing happens to her nothing happens she being protected by a totally rigged system  general james cartwright a fourstar general two weeks ago probably going to jail for up to five years for doing nothing by comparison but he said he did it for national security reasons and i can understand that go to jail for up to five years general betrayes his life was destroyed and here she is she is running for president 25 times worse than anybody has ever dreamt it a rigged system it is a rigged rigged system dont worry folks the cameras will never spin around and show this crowd they never do they show my face and the two people behind me not the thousands behind me they never do they never do  so dishonest there they are there they are my group women for trump women for trump theyve been following me these ladies for a long time how are we doing are we doing wellgreat people women for trumpand now it up to the american people to deliver the justice that we deserve at the ballot box tomorrow at the ballot box were going to wini think it a great way of showing what we have to show in light of what going on with justice in this country i really do i think it a great way you show it tomorrow we show it tomorrowmy contract with the american voter begins with a plan to end government corruption and to take our country back from the special interests and folks i was on the other side for a long time it a very good place to be but i love the country i love this country ive really gotten to love the people of this country because i have been everywhere we have the greatest people on earth but i love this countryand i couldnt watch it when they made the iran deal they gave them 150 billion a terrorist state a state that was ready to collapse until we made them rich and powerful we gave them a path to nuclear weapons they were ready to collapse we gave them remember 400 billion right we gave them 400 million then we found out that was  it wasnt 400 million it was 17 billion in cash in cash do you know what 17 billion in cash is you could take that whole side of the arena and you wouldnt have enough room how stupid are we to allow this to happen our leaders are incompetent president obama is campaigning today with hillary clinton because she cant campaign she cant campaign so obama is taking air force one which costs a fortune you know he very much into the environment and hell take a massive old engine 747 very much into the environment very much into the ozone layer and yet hell fly that 747 all over the place to campaign for crooked hillaryand i dont think it going to work and she not getting any crowds so she gets beyonce and jayz i like them i like them and you know what they do i get bigger crowds than they do it true i get far bigger crowds look at this place i mean look at the crowds we had in michiganby the way michigan is in play it hasnt been in play for republicans for 30 something years michigan is in play because theyre tired of watching their car factories be taken out theyre tired of losing their jobs to mexicoford ford right now moved all of its small car production to mexico theyre building the biggest plants in the world in mexico and michigan has been complaining about it for five years to mexico no were going to have some  tomorrow going to be a very historic day i really believe that i think it going to show  i think it going to be a brexit plus plus plus does that make sense plus plus plus it will be amazing it will be amazingi want the entire corrupt washington establishment to hear the words were all about to say this is a phrase i told you i didnt like it i thought it was hokie but it not hokie it called drain the swampwere going to go to washington were going to drain the swamp cant believe iti told the story i hated that expression i said no way im going to say that no way that so hokie and i said it the place went crazythen i said it to another place it went crazier then i said it with more confidence because you know confidence is  and it went wild now i love the expression i think it was geniusdrain the swamp drain the swamp is there any place better to be than a trump rally are we having fun are we having fun no and i dont have a guitar and i dont have a piano all we have is great concepts for our country which is the most important thing because frankly when people get on stage and theyre entertainers and they entertain in order to get people to fill up a room for hillary clintonand by the way they use the dirtiest language the other night and it was  many of the people left you know theyre political people they heard words theyve never heard before they leftso the place was half empty by the time  actually it never got full even with them then it was pretty much empty midway through and then most of the people just left and when hillary got up there was practically  she might as well just have started with a few people it wouldve been easier but you know she hears those words i wont use the words i wont even address the words because if i do the crooked media will say did you hear what donald trump said today but honestly  yes those words were disgusting if i ever said those words that jayz said or that beyonce said the other night you know what would happen to me the reinstitution of the electric chairit would be  how about if i got the answers to the debate or if i got the questions supposing instead of hillary getting the questions to the debate which is cheating she a cheat she is a cheat she never reported it she is a cheatso supposing instead of her  supposing somebody gave donald trump the questions to the debate headlines all over the world he must withdraw from the race you dont even hear anything about crooked hillary she got the questionsto me that such a big difference some people say my people oh dont mention that it just  i say to me it a big dealit a big deal but it not a big deal for the dishonest media to say they dont want to report it but just think about it supposing it was usat the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs bring them back to america and by the way you have a great governor support your governor he a great guy  where is he he here someplace he a great guy and he in a tough fight and he going to win that fight but he a great guy so hopefully youll support your governornorth carolina has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since nafta a deal signed by bill clinton and his lovely wife hillary well think of it think of it think of the numbers of jobshere the one that gets me the most two things get me the most two things that just dont seem real because were going to take care of our veterans right like big league because our veterans are greatbut two statistics i cant believe twentytwo suicides a day for our veteransthink of it you wouldnt think that possible because theyre treated so badly they wait on line for six seven eight days for simple procedure that could solve their problem or for a prescriptionbut two numbers i dont  it just doesnt make sense twentytwo suicides a day for our veterans ok it doesnt make senseand here another one america has lost 70000 factories now i thought they meant 700 or 7000 maybe it 70000 factories since china entered the world trade organization another bill and hillary clintonbacked disasterthink of it though think of what 70000 factories isso those are the two numbers they just dont seem to be real sad numbers sad numbers especially the vets to be honest with youwere living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of our world there never been anything happened to a country like has been happening to the united states our jobs are fleeing our companies are being taken and leaving and leavinga trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving america and we will stop the jobs from leaving north carolina believe me if a company wants to fire their workers and leave as an example north carolina and move to another country and then ship their products back into the united states through what will be a very strong border by the waywe will make them pay a 35 percent tax on every product that they ship back here and here what going to happen theyre not going to leave theyre not going to leavenow your politicians some of them dont understand it some only cut taxes for the middle class and by the way hillary clinton wants to raise your taxes and you know that substantiallyso one of the highest taxes in the world she wants to raise your taxes same old storywe will unleash the power of american energy including shale oil natural gas and clean coal our plan will end the epa intrusion into your family farms and stop double taxation of a family farm at that we will cancel billions in global warming payments to the united nations billions and billions of

effort with brand new advanced fighters flying from seymour johnson air force base beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful new fighters from seymour johnsonand were going to have more battalions you know the marines are way way off in terms of numbers you know that i know has there ever been yes there have been but rarely do we have times when we need this strong presence like now the world hates us the world hates usso were going to increase  thank you were going to increase marine battalions at camp lejeune ive been to camp lejeunethey make major new investments where i was the other night right next to it i guess like 25000 or 27000 people at fort bragg great people all soldiers are tough a couple of them shook my hand it was like oy whoa take it easy fellas they are tough cookies they

endorsements of more than 200 top admirals and generals and 22 medal of honor recipients and every day those numbers go up big league big league show less textand i asked some of the generals and admirals the other night by fort bragg i asked them i said fellas let me ask you a question they want to take over mosul am i getting something wrong whatever happened to the element of surprise for usim talking to admirals now and generals that what they do i do other things but you know it called like common senseyou got to say weve made a lot of right calls i said why is it that four months away from going into mosul theyre announcing we are going into mosul were going into mosul because we want to get the leaders of isis and theyre staying in mosul and then three months theyre saying we are going in in three months to mosul and then were going in in two monthsand every time i hear i put my hands i go like this i dont want to hear this please and as you know theyve been met with tremendous resistance much more than they wouldve beenand i guarantee you this i cant say it with certainty only about 999 percent ok i cant say  nothing 100 percent even our victory isnt 100 percent but it starting to look pretty close isnt it those numbers those numbers oh these guys are unhappy look at them theyre not happy they are unhappy campers starting to look good starting to look goodbut wouldnt it be nice if instead of announcing four months ago and there months ago then they have last  two weeks ago they go next week were getting ready to raidthe leaders all left theyre gone and the other people are putting up much more of a fight horrible theyre using human shields it a horrible situation i mean it hell it hellbut why do we just watch what going on hillary and her failed establishment have trillion dollars on wars in the middle east that we never win we just keep fighting and fighting it like a hose the money just keeps pouring out we never winand now the middle east

say i love you too because theyre going to make it a major headline if i said that world most dishonest people the world really dishonest people they dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe shipped our jobs and wealth all over  right open at home you ever notice we send these incredible troops so much death so much injury in order to create a border for a country that most people have never even heard of and yet we dont protect our own borders isnt it an incredible thingthat will change starting tomorrow because from now on it going to be america first america first so just in summing up to all americans i say it time for a real leadership and time for change we have to have change can you imagine having hillary for four years im being serious about that i wouldnt want to watch the news every nighti mean look at what she done with the emails as an example i mean did you ever see a mess like this did you ever see  of course the fbi  the director was obviously under tremendous pressure so they went through 650000 emails in eight days rightso sad what going on and she still deleted them after getting a subpoena from congress i mean that a crime what happened that a crime you dont even need the new stuff she shouldnt be allowed to run shouldnt be allowed to runjust think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days of a trump administration were

your social security and really injure medicare that what going to happenwe will eliminate every unnecessary jobkilling regulation well cancel every illegal obama executive order by the way a man that

must also be a secure nationsecurity begins at the borderhillary clinton is unfit to be president because she supports open bordersin fact as secretary of state she allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be freed into our country because their own countries wouldnt take them back  it was her job to cancel visas to countries that refused to take back their criminalsbut she didnt do itthe ice officers who endorsed me  their first endorsement of a candidate ever  issued a lengthy statement on hillary clinton immigration planslet me read from itagain this all a quote from the ice officers hillary clinton has promised the most radical immigration proposal in us historyher radical plan would result in the loss of thousands of innocent american lives mass victimization and death for many attempting to immigrate to the united states the total gutting of interior enforcement the handcuffing of ice officers and an uncontrollable flood of illegal immigrants across us borderstheir quote continuesshe proposes to keep and expand executive amnesty to expand catch andrelease to expand president obama nonenforcement priorities to the point where there is virtually no real immigration enforcement or policing of visa overstays to support sanctuary cities to extend obamacare to illegal immigrants to grant amnesty within 100 days to extend social security and medicare to illegal immigrants through amnesty plus a 550 increase in the admission of syrian refugeesthe ice officers conclude by saying her plan is total amnesty plus open bordersthat whole quote is from the nation immigration and customs enforcement officers in short hillary immigration stance is disqualifyingthe first duty of the president of the united states is to protect the citizens of the united states  anyone who fails to understand that is unworthy to lead this nationthere are more than 2 million criminal aliens with convictions in the country right now and many more criminal illegal immigrants who have committed severe offenses but escaped the law entirely  when i am president we are getting them out and we are getting them out quicklyat the same time our country is being infiltrated by

economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words jobs jobs jobswe will cut taxes for all working and middleclass households in americawe will reduce regulations which will put more money into the hands of our poorest workers and bring thousands of new companies to our shoreswe will unleash american energy creating millions of new jobs and lowering energy costs the obamaclinton energy restrictions are nothing more than a massive tax on the poor  we will remove those restrictions day onewe will repeal and replace disastrous obamacarepresident obama promised his plan would reduce premiums by 2500 dollars instead they surged 5000our replacement plan includes expanded access to healthcare savings accounts with support for those who need it it includes allowing americans to buy health insurance across state lines in all 50 states creating a dynamic and competitive new market  they will be competing for your businesswere also going to block grant medicaid so states can develop innovative solutions to make sure no citizen in poverty ever falls through the cracks highrisk pools will also help to ensure that those with preexisting conditions will always get the quality coverage they needon trade we are going to end the international abuse the foreign cheating and the onesided rules that govern nafta and the world trade organization right now america eliminates its tariffs but then other countries tax our goods with backdoor tariffs and close their marketsour massive chronic trade deficits are destroying the middle class  and shifting money away from workers to large corporations who have no borders there a reason hedge funds and wall street are giving tens of millions to my opponenthillary clinton is the voice for the global special interestsi am running to be the voice of the forgotten men and womenmy opponent likes to say that for decades she has been fighting for women that she has been fighting for childrenwhy then are 70 million american women and children living in poverty or on the brink of poverty why has she provided no relief for the millions of americans in search of affordable reliable quality childcare you know the old saying watch what i do not what i sayat the trump organization and in my campaign for president women occupy some of the highest positions i have employed thousands of women in my company women of different backgrounds women of many talentsand just last week joined by my daughter ivanka i laid out my plan for childcare and eldercare that plan has many great features including taxfree childcare savings accounts lowincome parents are given tax credits they can put straight into those accounts and then get a 500 dollar per child match for those savings accounts depositsfamilies can also deduct the cost of childcare from their taxes a huge tax cut for the middle classwe have also talked about improving education my plan includes school choice for every disadvantaged child in americawe are also going to bring down the cost of collegeuniversities get massive federal funds and huge tax breaks for their endowments  but then they dont spend those funds or those endowments on their students i will work with congress to make sure these special federal benefits are not available unless universities begin to reduce tuition and student debt this will get to the problem at the source and reduce both the cost for students and the cost for taxpayers our students are drowning and were going to fix itwomen also value security they want a commanderinchief that will defeat radical islamic terrorism stop the massive inflow of refugees protect our borders and who will reduce the rising crime and violence in our citiesas i campaign across this country i hear so many stories and pleas from women especially about drug addiction and opioid use they are doing their best in their communities and for their families to provide a safe and nurturing environmentbut even the bestlaid plans cannot always protect our youth and increasingly many adults from the scourge of drugs we lose thousands of our fellow americans every year to opioid use i will stop the drug inflow from our borders these drugs come over the border and make their way into our urban and rural communities and into our suburbsthis must change every change starts with a conversation together we will have this conversation and we will make this changethe changes will start immediatelyhere in virginia we are going to end the war on american energy hillary clinton says she wants to put the miners out of work clinton and kaine also want to shut down shale and shut down natural gas the clinton regulatory agenda will drive up electricity prices for virginia families and will cost the us economy over 5 trillionby the way less than a week after taking office tim kaine proposed a 4 billion dollar tax hike in virginia including on people earning as little as 17000 dollars a yearwe are going to open up all sources of american energy and bring jobs wealth and cheaper electricity to virginiaanother major part of our agenda is safetyi believe every family in america is entitled to live in safety and peacetoday the nation just opened the smithsonian national museum of africanamerican history and culture we congratulate and honor those involved with the project and recognize today the incredible contributions of the africanamerican community to this nationafricanamericans have given so much to this nation and sacrificed so much for this nationmany africanamericans are succeeding so greatly in our country and i will make sure their success is protected and supportedat the same time too many africanamericans have been left behind and trapped in povertyi will fight to make sure every single africanamerican child in this country is fully included in the american dreamthat includes the new civil rights issue of our time school choicedemocrats have run the inner cities for half a century or more and produced only more joblessness and povertythe jobs are leaving the schools are failing and crime is risingto those suffering i say vote for donald trump what do you have to lose i will fix it i will fight harder for you than anyone has beforethe policies of hillary clinton have brought only suffering in our inner cities  just like her bad judgment overseas unleashed suffering everywhere she wentof course she got rich through it all  the clintons made another 60 million in gross income while she was secretary of stateworst of all she put her public office up for sale  and then bleached her emails and destroyed her phones to try to cover her tracks following a congressional subpoenathere a reason the hedge fund managers are donating to hillary clinton campaign  and not mine everybody getting rich off the rigged system and who wants nothing to change are throwing their money at hillary clintonmy campaign is powered by my own money and by small dollar donations from everyday patriotic citizens95 of our donors are small dollar donations every dollar helps us deliver your country back to youour campaign is about breaking up the special interest monopoly in washington dc were trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors the large corporations and the media executives theyre all part of the same political establishmentthey go to the same restaurants they

other countriesi am not running to be president of the world i am running to be president of the united states i am for america  and america firsttogether we will rebuild this country beyond our

60,wow tremendous wow thank you very much thank you unbelievable people dont know i worked in ohio did you know that and i had a great experience and if i didnt have a great experience starting out when i was very young maybe i wouldnt be here right now who knows you need that it was great for confidence also in 12 days were going to win ohio and we are going to win back the white house a brand new poll from remington research highly respected has just a few minutes ago come out and in ohio we are right now four points up early voting is underway so make sure get out and vote we dont wanna we dont wanna give this away no!you know we have a movement going on like theyve never seen before in this country drain the swamps youve gotta a drain the swamp sign back there were going to drain the swamp believe me but this is a movement like theyve never seen in this country before and every place is packed and the greatest people on earth and were going to turn our country around were going to turn it around fast seventyfive percent of the people think our country is headed in the wrong direction we know it headed in the wrong direction were going to fix it were going to take our country back and it going to be put very quickly on the right track real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing obamacare it just been announced that americans are going to experience another massive doubledigit hike in obamacare you see that including premiums like in the great state of arizona where theyre going to go up at 116 percent dont worry youll be there very soon unless i win in which case youre not going to have to worry about it even bill clinton admitted that obamacare is quote the craziest thing in the world where people wind up paying their premiums which double and their coverage is cut in halfjob killing job killing obamacare is just one more way the system is rigged remember the name jonathan gruber the architect of obamacare he said they could pass obamacare when he didnt know he was being recorded he said they could pass obamacare because the stupidity of the american voter will allow it to take place the only stupidity was that incredible stupidity shown by our politicians when they forced this bill through over the furious objection to many politicians in all fairness many many politicians but really the american people and it was very very sad and in all fairness to the democrats had our president not lied 28 times remember you can keep your plan you can keep your doctor it passed by this much they would not have gone for it but they believed him too like everybody else believed himtheyve caught them in a lot of lies lately folks hillary clinton talking about liars wants to double down hillary clinton wants to double down on obamacare and make it even worse so here im going to repeal it replace it were going to have a replacement that is so much less expensive and so much better you dont even get to use obamacare because the deductible is so high and you know it just look it is so it is so out of control youll never get to use it four or five thousand dollars before you can start taking just this and just happened hillary clinton declared that obamacare do you remember this not so long ago as one of the greatest accomplishments of president obama of the democratic party and of our county it a total disaster here in ohio another five insurance companies are dropping out of obamacare good luck good luck in negotiations folks that means that all the residents covered by plans from these companies will be getting cancellation notices very soon obamacare is really and you know this a catastrophe it a catastrophic event for ohio workers and is making it impossible for many parents to pay their bills support their families or get quality medical care to their children repealing obamacare is one of the single most important reasons we must win on november eighth have to win real change also means getting rid of the corruption in washington dc hillary clinton bleached and deleted 33000 emails lied to congress under oath made 13 phone calls i mean 13 13 phones made them disappear sometimes with a hammer right wrong wrong let get rid of these and then told the fbi she could remember 39 different timesthe clinton crew gave more than 675000 to the wife of the deputy director of the fbi and the man who was overseeing the investigation into hillary illegal server a server we now know obama knew about just found that out yesterday wikileaks the more emails wikileaks releases the more lies between the clinton foundation the secretary of state office and the clintons personal finances they all get blurredjust today we read about clinton confidante doug brand bragging that he had funneled tens of millions of dollars to bill clinton inc through the foundation donations paid speeches and consulting contracts mr band called the arrangement unorthodox the rest of us call it outright corrupt in fact the clinton foundation even hired a law firm to find out if their pay to play scheme would jeopardize their charitable status with the irsif the clintons were willing to play this fast and loose with their enterprise when they werent in the white house just imagine what theyll do given the change to once again control the oval office and weve had enough honestly i think weve had enough of the clintons in all fairness right dont you agree had enough i mean at what point at what point do we say it hillary clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the presidency i propose a contract with the american voter that will end the corruption and give the government back to the people i want the entire corrupt washington establishment to hear and to heed the words im about to say if we win on november eighth when ok ok when we win on november eighth we dont want to take it for granted but we are winning in a lot of states i have to say the media now theyre going wild the media going wild because theyre saying you know this guy winning in florida he winning in north carolina he winning in iowa he winning in ohio all right when we win right we are going to washington dc and we are going to drain the swamp a lot of spirit in this room it a good one that includes a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of congress at the core of my contract is my economic plan that plan can be summarized in three very beautiful words especially for the people in this area and this room jobs jobs jobsno it terrible what happened what happened in this area what happened in this country with jobs is terrible hillary clinton promised to bring upstate new york 200000 jobs when she ran for senate instead the jobs left they didnt come in they left she been there for 30 years and hasnt fixed anything she just made things worse except for herself and her husbandfortyseven million americans are on food stamps and 45 million americans live in poverty nearly one in four americans in their prime earning years are not working or able to work seventy million american women and children are in poverty or on the brink of poverty and nearly half of africanamerican children under the age of six are living in abject povertyour national debt has doubled in eight years and our infrastructure throughout our country is crumbling bad shape our airports our roads our bridges our tunnels our schools our hospitals our trade deficit with the world is now nearly 800 billion a year we are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world think of it and that so true the single greatest jobs theft in the history of the worldwhat our politicians have allowed to happen to this area but to all areas of our country nafta tpp they want to approve a disaster ohio has lost one in four manufacturing jobs since nafta a deal signed by bill clinton and supported strongly by hillary clinton remember every time you see a closed factory a wiped out community in ohio it was essentially caused by the clintons it was nafta it was caused by the clintons why a deal like that was allowedweve lost 70000 factories think of that one 70 i tell everybody it a typo cant be 70000 it is weve lost 70000 factories since china entered the world trade organization another bill and hillarybacked disaster just this year eaton corporation in ohio closed its plant laid off 152 workers and moved their jobs to mexico and youve had many i could i could name them all day longunder my contract if a company wants to fire their workers move to mexico or other countries and ship their products back into the united states we will put a 35 percent tariff on those products and folks just in case you have any questions when that happens youre not losing your companies anymore and if you do at least the country gonna make a lot of money ok we will immediately begin renegotiating nafta and if we dont get the deal we want  right now it a oneway highway we lose our jobs we lose our companies we lose everything we lose our cash they get the cash they get the jobs they get the companies we get the drugs we get the unemployment that what we get we get nothing we get less than nothingwe will terminate nafta and get a much better deal for our workers if we cant renegotiate it properly were gonna get a better deal for our workers and for our companies because we cannot continue to be the people led by stupid people we cant we cant as part of our plan to bring back american jobs we will lower taxes on our businesses from 35 percent down to 15 percent we will also cut taxes for middle class families by 35 percent and massively simplify taxes for all americans we will be a rich nation once again but to be a rich country we must also be a safe country hillary clinton unleashed isis onto the world you know that story and spreading violently it spreading now into the united states there are now 1000 open isis investigations in the united states isis is on a campaign of genocide against christians in the middle east or what they call the nation of the cross ok the nation of the crossthey are crucifying drowning and beheading their victims this is something that we would read about in history books and not since medieval times right have you heard the beheadings and all the things that are happening so we have no choice we will stop isis and we still stop them fast and unlike what theyve done in mosul which is turning out to be very difficult were not giving three and four months notice were coming in were coming in you think general george patton would say were coming in in three or four months get ready what a bunch theyre throwing people off buildings hanging their victims from meat hooks theyre hanging their victims from meat hooks the new york post just published reports about isis crushing children to death and burning adults alivenow hillary wants massive immigration from the most dangerous regions of the world where isis operates including a 550 percent increase in syrian refugees over and above the thousands and thousands that president obama is taking we dont want isis in our country the hillary refugee plan would leave us with generations of terrorism radicalism and extremism inside of our shores i only want to admit people who will support this country and love its people so important keeping our families safe is the highest obligation of the president of the united states a trump administration is going to suspend immigration from terrorprone regions and we will suspend the syrian refugee program that was easy were not going to take the risk when it comes to the safety of the american people no longer so let me state this as clearly as i can if im elected president i am going to keep radical islamic terrorists the hell out of our country hillary also said she wants totally open borders no one who supports open borders can ever serve as president of the united states totally open borders a trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the united states and yes we will build a wall have to we have to build that wall build that wall build that walland who is going to pay for the wall one hundred percent mexico in terms of our trade deficits is making a fortune off the united states their leaders are doing a much smarter job but you know what well be happy with mexico mexico gonna be wonderful were going to have a great relationship with mexico with china and with other  we dont even have good relationships now they rip us off and we still dont get along at least they should be nice to us theyre not even nice theyll be nicethousands of americans have been killed by illegal immigrants right here in ohio sixtyyear old margaret costleman was murdered in cold blood by an illegal immigrant earlier that day her killer shot another woman in the arm while she was with her children in a nearby park police encountered the man more than three weeks before the crime scene but federal authorities refused to take him into custody even though people were saying please please dont let him out please take him inthen there is the case of 90year old earl olander a minnesota farmer who was brutally beaten by illegal immigrants and left to bleed to death in his home earl body was found with his hands bound behind his back with duct tape a blunt force injury to his head his killers had criminal records but they did not meet the obama administration priorities for removal but others that knew him and others that knew them were pleading were pleading dont let them out dont let them into our society i have a message for the cartels the drug dealers and the gang members when i win your long reign of crime and terror and horror will come to a very beautiful crashing end we will also repeal obamaclinton defense cuts and rebuild our badly depleted military our air force is the smallest and oldest it

have your back believe me i have your back we will she just said make america great again mr trump we will make america great again dont worry about it we will and it wont take too long we will change our foreign policy hillary clinton policies in iraq syria libya threw the middle east into total turmoil were spending 6 trillion on wars in the middle east while our own country falls into total disrepair now hillary wants to start a shooting war in syria conflict with a nuclear power  russia  which could very well lead to world war iiiand the way she talks about putin she always said she has no idea but she always saying wikileak it russia and donald trump i have nothing to do with russiashe said maybe donald trump is involved in projects with the russians the answer no no but what she does she says donald trump and russia look look she speaks so badly of putin nuclear country she speaks so badly i say and she uses it to keep trying to get votesi said to myself you know how do you speak so badly of somebody i mean how are they going to ever get along wouldnt it be great if we actually got along with russia and other countries and we together went after isis and knocked the hell out of them wouldnt that be a good thing because they want to get them out also but she speaks very badly of putin and i dont think that smart you know you can be very tough but you shouldnt be doing what she doing as her own team has said in wikileaks she has terrible instincts to all americans i say it time for new leadership it really is time it really is can you imagine four more years of obama that what you got to it high taxes it high regulations all these companies they cant even breathe with the regulations unnecessary it isis all over the place you know she says shell stop isis let me tell you there was no isis there was no isis during her term she created with obama a vacuum in iraq isis formed and then obama called them the jv junior varsity rightwell theyre not the jv anymore folks theyre going to be no trouble we are going to knock them so hard but look look theyre not the jv and they werent them and now theyre in 32 different countries so she saying we will get rid of isis she wants to go back home and go to sleep that what she wants to do did you see where she got upset yesterday because i took a little while just a few hours to cut a ribbon to make sure my

understands itthe obama administration has just announced massive double digit and triple digit obamacare premium hikes everywhere all throughout the country here in pennsylvania premiums are going to increase more than 60 percent and that nothing compared to what will happen in the future of course in the future im president there wont be obamacare so you wont have to worry about it that means parents wont have enough money to pay their bills or get medicine for their kids in the great state of arizona a wonderful place i just left premiums will go up even higher than 116 percent other states are going up more than 60 70 80 90 percent deductibles can go to 12000 13000 14000 even 15000 in other words your health care wont even be usable youre paying all this money you wont even get to use itpeople all across the country are devastated in many instances their health care costs are more than their mortgage costs or their rent which by the way is a first in american history this is particularly unfair to millennials and younger americans generally who will be totally crushed by these massive health care costs before they even get started on their journey through lifeonethird of the counties  think of this onethird of the counties in pennsylvania will have only a single insurance company left if you have that that includes philadelphia where i went to school the associated press found that some of the 440000 pennsylvania consumers who buy insurance through healthcaregov will face some of the highest premium increases in the nation the people of philadelphia insurers are leaving premiums are soaring doctors are quitting companies are fleeing and deductibles go through the roof workers hours are being cut hiring is frozen  totally frozen  and wages are being slashed obamacare means higher prices fewer choices and lower quality yet hillary clinton wants to expand obamacare and make it even more expensive she wants to put the government totally in charge of health care in america if we dont repeal and replace obamacare we will destroy american health care foreverit one of the single most important reasons why we must win on november 8th we must win thank you thank youthank you very much everybody thank youour replacement plan includes health savings accounts a nationwide insurance market where you can purchase across state lines and letting states manage medicaid dollars so much better we will create quality reliable affordable health care in a free market where parents can make the health care decisions that they really wanna make for their families it will be a much better health care at a much less expensive costweve also outlined detailed solutions on so many other issues to make life better for every american family and while this is really  thank you while this is really a meeting and that what it is it a meeting of very very special people and i appreciate you all being here but it a meeting talking about health care and obamacare our plan for other things also include the bringing back of manufacturing jobs we have to do it  were gonna bring back your manufacturing were gonna bring back our jobs that formed the backbone of the american middle class and our country as a wholeour jobs are being stolen pennsylvania has lost almost 40 percent of its manufacturing jobs since nafta a deal signed by bill clinton and supported by hillary clinton the city of philadelphia has lost more than onethird of its manufacturing jobs since china joined the word trade organization another bill and hillarybacked disastera trump administration will renegotiate nafta believe me and we have the greatest negotiators in the world we will use our great negotiators well have a fair deal but well have a deal that goes in two directions not one direction right into mexico and these other places and stand up to foreign product dumping currency manipulation and unfair subsidy behavior we are going to bring manufacturing jobs lots of jobs back to pennsylvania were gonna do it and it wont even be difficult were going to open modern mines and take care of our great miners our miners have been mistreated horribly we will be producing clean coal oil natural gas and shale energy were also bringing back our steel workers who have been so badly hurt so badly hurt whose jobs have been stolen by the dumping of steel all over the state and frankly all over this country by china and other countries nobody has been treated worse than these workers but that will change on january 20th of next year believe me it will change were also going to provide the children of the state with school choice so important that means parents can spend and take care of their children but they can send their kids to public school to private to chartered to magnet to religious or to home school it going to be their right and it going to be something that so so good for your children and for the education of your children we will also totally eliminate common core and bring education local were gonna bring it local people do not like common core in this country that i can tell you and our system is failing so it obviously not working were gonna eliminate common core were gonna bring it localour tax plan will provide a 35 percent tax cut to middle class families with two kids as an example you have two kids a 35 percent cut so desperately needed our middle class has not been properly respected that i can tell you we will let parents deduct childcare expenses from their taxes and create taxfree childcare and elder care savings accounts with matching contributions for low income families we will eliminate the obamaclinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military when did we ever need it more greatest people on earth in our military but it badly depleted thank you people love this country dont they isnt it beautiful right beautiful it a beautiful thing to watch and see and i see it all over the country no matter where we go and every time i say we are going to rebuild our depleted military it always the same response it an incredible response our navy is the smallest it been since world war i think of that smallest since world war i and rebuilding it will require a national effort that why i will ask my secretary of the navy to review facilities like the philadelphia navy yard i know it well with a long history of service to our navy proximity to vibrant private industry and room for expansion to enlist them in the rebuilding of what will be a great fleet again to recruit master craftsmen this buildup requires and we will establish centers of excellence at locations like the philadelphia navy yardvocational training is a great thing we dont do it anymore we dont do it anymore and i must tell you so often in going to college right down the road and going to college we have people that were brilliant and we had other people that werent as brilliant in that way but were brilliant incredible when it came to fixing a motor when it came to fixing something that i had no idea what was happening and other great geniuses had no idea what was happening and they could take it apart blindfolded and we dont do that anymore vocational training for our country is so so so important and just in closing  and they loved it they loved it they didnt want to be doing what i was doing they loved it they were so good at it and they loved it so vocational training were going to start it up big league we will rebuild our military and we will rebuild our country im not a politician my only special interest is you the american people that why ive done this thank you very much the guiding rule of the political class in washington dc is that they are looking out only for themselves only for themselves with the exception of these few people i feel guilty as im looking theyre staring me in the eyes so i have to say with these exceptions they will say anything and do anything and cling to their power and prestige at your expense im running to change and reverse decades of failure and to work with the american people to create generations of success im running im running to restore honesty to our government and safety to our communities we need safety and by the way our law enforcement officials these are great great people thank you and we are going to give

inner cities the spirit of the people in the inner cities is beyond the spirit of anybody and it gonna work it gonna work you watch americans are tired of being told to defer their dreams to another day but politicians for the most part really mean another decade because that what theyre talking about enough waiting time is nowbut to accomplish our goals we must cut our ties with the small bitter petty politics of the past we must declare our independence from a failed establishment that has squandered 6 trillion on foreign wars in the middle east that never end that we never win and that have made us far less safe think of it think of all the money that spent all the lives that have been lostand were far less safe today than we were before we started theyve left our borders wide open at home and shipped our jobs and wealth to other countriesit time for new leadership ive led a great life and i truly love our country so now i want to give back to the country that been so good to me that why im doing this all i see everywhere i travel in this nation and ive been everywhere is untapped potential waiting to be realized the people are amazing the people are amazing if we unlock the

64,it so great to be here tonight i am honored to also be joined this evening by governor scott walker chairman reince priebus and mayor rudy giulianiwe are at a decisive moment in this electionlast week i laid out my plan to bring jobs back to our country yesterday i laid out my plan to defeat radical islamic terrorism tonight i am going to talk about how to make our communities safe again from crime and lawlessnesslet me begin by thanking the law enforcement officers here in this city and across this country for their service and sacrifice in difficult timesthe violence riots and destruction that have taken place in milwaukee is an assault on the right of all citizens to live in security and peacelaw and order must be restored it must be restored for the sake of all but most especially the sake of those living in the affected communitiesthe main victims of these riots are lawabiding africanamerican citizens living in these neighborhoods it is their jobs their homes their schools and communities which will suffer as a resultthere is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct crime and violence is an attack on the poor and will never be accepted in a trump administrationthe narrative that has been pushed aggressively for years now by our current administration and pushed by my opponent hillary clinton is a false one the problem in our poorest communities is not that there are too many police the problem is that there are not enough policemore law enforcement more community engagement more effective policing is what our country needsjust like hillary clinton is against the miners she is against the police you know it and i know itthose peddling the narrative of cops as a racist force in our society  a narrative supported with a nod by my opponent  share directly in the responsibility for the unrest in milwaukee and many other places within our countrythey have fostered the dangerous antipolice atmosphere in americaeverytime we rush to judgment with false facts and narratives  whether in ferguson or in baltimore  and foment further unrest we do a direct disservice to poor africanamerican residents who are hurt by the high crime in their communitiesduring the last 72 hours while protestors have raged against the police here in milwaukee another 9 were killed in chicago and another 46 were wounded more than 2600 people have been shot in chicago since the beginning of the year and almost 4000 killed in president obama hometown area since his presidency beganhow are we serving these american victims by attacking law enforcement officersthe war on our police must end it must end nowthe war on our police is a war on all peaceful citizens who want to be able to work and live and send their kids to school in safetyour job is not to make life more comfortable for the rioter the looter the violent disruptor our job is to make life more comfortable for the africanamerican parent who wants their kids to be able to safely walk the streets or the senior citizen waiting for a bus or the young child walking home from schoolfor every one violent protestor there are a hundred moms and dads and kids on that same city block who just want to be able to sleep safely at night my opponent would rather protect the offender than the victimhillary clintonbacked policies are responsible for the problems in the inner cities today and a vote for her is a vote for another generation of poverty high crime and lost opportunitiesi care too much about my country to let that happenwe all care too much about our

65,thank you it is so great to be here in floridain 26 days we are going to win the state and we are going to win the white houseour movement is about replacing a failed and corrupt political establishment with a new government controlled by you the american peoplethere is nothing the political establishment will not do and no lie they will not tell to hold on to their prestige and power at your expensethe washington establishment and the financial and media corporations that fund it exists for only one reason to protect and enrich itselfthe establishment has trillions of dollars at stake in this election as an example just one single trade deal theyd like to pass involves trillions of dollars controlled by many countries corporations and lobbyistsfor those who control the levers of power in washington and for the global special interests they partner with our campaign represents an existential threatthis is not simply another 4year election this is a crossroads in the history of our civilization that will determine whether or not we the people reclaim control over our governmentthe political establishment that is trying everything to stop us is the same group responsible for our disastrous trade deals massive illegal immigration and economic and foreign policies that have bled this country dry the political establishment has brought about the destruction of our factories and our jobs as they flee to mexico china and other countries throughout the world our justannounced jobs numbers are anemic and our gross domestic product or gdp is barely above one percent workers in the united states were making less than they were almost 20 years ago  and yet they are working harderit a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class stripped our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entitiesjust look at what this corrupt establishment has done to our cities like detroit and flint michigan  and rural towns in pennsylvania ohio north carolina and across our country they have stripped these towns bare and raided the wealth for themselves and taken away their jobsthe clinton machine is at the center of this power structure weve seen this firsthand in the wikileaks documents in which hillary clinton meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of us sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powersand likewise the emails show that the clinton machine is so closely and irrevocably tied to media organizations that she is given the questions and answers in advance of her debates clinton is also given approval and veto power over quotes written about her in the new york times and the emails show the reporters collaborate and conspire directly with the clinton campaign on helping her win the electionwith their control over our government at stake with trillions of dollars on the line the clinton machine is determined to achieve the destruction of our campaign which has now become a movement the likes of which our country has never seen before  and we wont let them do thatthe most powerful weapon deployed by the clintons is the corporate media let be clear on one thing the corporate media in our country is no longer involved in journalism they are a political special interest no different than any lobbyist or other financial entity with an agenda and their agenda is to elect the clintons at any cost at any price no matter how many lives they destroyfor them it is a war  and for them nothing is out of boundsthis is a struggle for the survival of our nation this election will determine whether we are a free nation or whether we have only the illusion of democracy but are in fact controlled by a small handful of global special interests rigging the systemthis is not just conspiracy but reality and you and i know itthe establishment and their media enablers wield control over this nation through means that are well known anyone who challenges their control is deemed a sexist a racist a xenophobe and morally deformed they will attack you they will slander you they will seek to destroy your career and reputation and they will lie lie and lie even morethe clintons are criminals this is welldocumented and the establishment that protects them has engaged in a massive coverup of widespread criminal activity at the state department and clinton foundation in order to keep the clintons in power never in history have we seen such a coverup as this one that includes the destruction of 33000 emails 13 phones laptops missing boxes of evidence and on and onpeople who are capable of such crimes against our nation are capable of anythingand so now we address the slander and libels that was just last night thrown at me by the clinton machine the new york times and other media outlets as part of a concerted coordinated and vicious attackit is not coincidence that these attacks come at the exact same moment and all together at the same time as the wikileaks documents expose the massive international corruption of the clinton machine  including 2000 more emails this morningthese claims about me of inappropriate conduct with women are totally and absolutely false  and the clinton machine knows it is it all fabricated it pure fiction and outright lies these events never happened the claims are preposterous ludicrous and defy truth common sense and logicwe already have substantial evidence to dispute these lies and it will be made public in the appropriate way and at the appropriate time these lies come from outlets whose past stories and past claims have already been discredited the media outlets did not even attempt to confirm the most basic facts because even a simple investigation would have shown these are false smearswhat happening to me is no different than what happened to other innocent people like the story written in rolling stone magazine  and that magazine should be put out of businesssix months ago the new york times wrote a massive story attacking me and the central witness they used said the story was false that she was quoted inaccurately she said i was a great guy and never made those remarkswe demanded a retraction but they refused to print it  just like they refused to print the comments from another source who praised me in her book or the words of another wonderful woman who said nice thingsthat story was a fraud and an embarrassment to the new york times it will be part of the lawsuit we are preparing against them now today the same two discredited writers who should have been fired from the times tell a totally fabricated and false story that supposedly took place on an airplane more than 30 years ago  another ridiculous tale no witnesses no nothingalso a writer from people magazine who wrote a story on melania and myself on our first anniversary the story was lovely but last night we hear after 12 years a new claim that i made inappropriate advances i ask a very simple question why wasnt it part of the story that appeared 12 years ago i was one of the biggest stars on television and it would have been one of the biggest stories of the year take a look at her words it would have been the headline no it only appears 26 days before the electionthis invented account has already been debunked by eyewitness testimony  the very witness identified by the author has said the story is entirely falsethis weekend the new york times published a fullpage hit piece with another claim from an individual who has been totally discredited based on the emails and letters she has sent to our office over the years but the new york times refused to use the evidence we presented them others have likewise were presented with this story but after seeing the evidence we provided refused to print itthis is part of a concerted effort led by the new york times which is fighting desperately for its relevance and survival and which probably wont even be around in a few years based on its financial outlook has become more and more vicious and vilei will not allow the clinton machine to turn this campaign into a discussion of their slanders and lies but will remain focused on the issues facing the american peoplebut let me state this as clearly as i can these attacks are orchestrated by the clintons and their media allies they are false and slanderous in every respect we are now less than a month from the most important election of our lifetime  indeed one the most important elections in modern history  and the polls show us in a dead heat and the new rasmussen poll shows us 2 points aheadso now the clinton machine has put forward a small handful of people out of the tens of thousands i have met worked with and employed  in order to make wild and false allegations that fail to meet even the most basic test of common sense again this is nothing more than an attempt to destroy our movement and for the clintons to keep their corrupt control over this governmentwhen i declared my candidacy i knew what bad shape our country was in i had seen firsthand the corruption and the sickness that has taken over our politics i knew they would throw every lie they could at me and my family and my loved onesi knew they would stop at nothing to try to stop mebut i take all of these slings and arrows for you i take them for our movement so that we can have our country backour great civilization here in america and across the civilized world has come upon a moment of reckoningweve seen it in the united kingdom where they voted to liberate themselves from global government and global trade deals and global immigration deals that have destroyed their sovereigntybut the central base of world political power is here in america and it is our corrupt political establishment that is the greatest power behind the efforts at radical globalization and the disenfranchisement of working peopletheir financial resources are unlimited their political resources are unlimited their media resources are unlimited and most importantly the depths of their immorality is unlimitedour political establishment has no souli knew these false attacks would come i knew this day would arrive and i knew the american people would rise above it and vote for the future they deservethe only thing that can stop the corrupt clinton machine is you the only force strong enough to save this country is you the only people brave enough to vote out this corrupt establishment is you the american peoplethey control the department of justice and they even clandestinely meet with the attorney general of the united states  in the back of her airplane while on the runway  for 39 minutes  to most likely discuss her reappointment in a clinton administration just prior to the attorney general making a decision over whether or not to prosecute hillary clintonlikewise they have corrupted the director of the fbi to the point at which stories are already saying the great men and women who work for the fbi are embarrassed and ashamed to what he done to one of our great institutions hillary clinton is guilty of all of the things that director comey stated at his press conference and congressional hearings and far more  and yet he let her off the hook while others lives are being destroyed for far lessthis is a conspiracy against you the american peoplethis is our moment of reckoning as a society and as a civilizationi didnt need to do this i built a great company and i had a wonderful life i could have enjoyed the benefits of years of successful business for myself and my family instead of going through this absolute horror show of lies deceptions and malicious attacks im doing it because this country has given me so much and i feel strongly it was my turn to give backsome people warned me this campaign would be a journey to hell but they are wrong it will be a journey to heaven because we will help so many peoplein my former life i was an insider as much as anybody else  and i know what like to be an insider now i am being punished for leaving their special club and revealing to you their great scam because i used to be part of the club im the only one who can fix it im doing this for the people and this movement is just right  and we will take back this country for you and make america great againthe corrupt establishment knows that we are an existential threat to their criminal enterprise they know that if we win their power is gone and returned to you the clouds hanging over our government can be lifted and replaced with a bright future  but it all depends on whether we let the new york times decide our future or whether we let the american people decide our futureif this clinton campaign of destruction is allowed to work then no other highly successful person  which is what our country needs  will ever again run for this officei will not lie to you these false attacks hurt to be lied about to be slandered to be smeared so publicly and before your family is painfulwhat the clinton machine is doing to me and my family is egregious beyond words it is reprehensible beyond descriptionbut i also know it not about me  it about all of you it about all of us together as a countryit about the veterans who need medical care the mothers whove lost children to terrorism and crime it about the inner cities and the border towns who desperately need our help it about the millions of jobless americans this election is about the people being crushed by obamacare and it about defeating isis and appointing supreme court justices who will defend our constitutionthis election is also about the africanamerican and hispanic communities whose communities have been plunged into crime poverty and failing schools by the policies of hillary clinton theyve robbed these citizens of their future and i will give them their hope jobs and opportunities back i will deliverthis election is about every man woman and child in our country who deserves to live in safety prosperity and peacewe will rise above the lies the smears and the ludicrous slanders from ludicrous reporterswe will vote for the country we wantwe will vote for the future we wantwe will vote for the politics we wantwe will vote to put this corrupt government cartel out of business we will remove from our politics the special interests who have betrayed our workers our borders our freedoms and our sovereign rights as a nation we will end the politics of profit we will end the rule of special interests we will put a stop to the raiding of our country  and the disenfranchisement of our peopleour independence day is at hand and it arrives finally on november 8th join me in taking back our country and creating a bright and glorious new dawn for our people
66,thank you thank you very much  thank you very much so amazing rudy just left he just said i dont believe this this is unbelievable nobody believes itthe crowds were getting  im the messenger but ill tell you what the message is the right message were tired of incompetence were tired of not taking care of our military were tired of not taking care of our vets who are being taken care of very poorlywere tired of so many different things and this is what happens so our mayor my friend rudy giuliani just walks im telling you he said i dont believe this this is incredibleand what he hasnt seen and your governor by the way who a great guyand he now seeing it theyre walking outside because there are thousands of people outside that cant get in i said rudy you think this is bad go take a look outsideso i just want to thank pat and rudy and i want to thank everybody for being here and we are going to have a good time we love north carolina we love north carolina we did really well in the primaries if you remember and i hear we are doing really well now we have to win that november 8 day is so importantyou know i bring things up like the judges right supreme court justices we have to get  you know you could have as many as four i guess it a scenario where this president could pick five supreme court justicesand if you pick two that are left left left it going to be a disaster for our country your second amendment the national rifle association endorsed and they endorsed me early a long time ago and theyre great people wayne and chris they are great people but if you  if you do something with these  ill tell you what justices right now you lost a great one with scalia we want to replace with justices very much like justice scalia and that going to happen it is so importantso if for no other reason i mean it such an important  it one of the most important elections for a lot of reasons not just that but for a lot of reasons but that so obviously because for whatever reason they say this could be the presidency this next four years is where you will pick more supreme court justices than anybody has every had the opportunity to do believe me ill make you very proud of those justices everyday so we had an incident a few days ago with the 400 million  all cash right  400 million in all cash anybody know what that looks like that a lot of cash that a lot of caseand honestly it so sad think of it going to iran a terrorist state now i happen to think they have plenty of money weve given then 150 billion so the 400 million is just you know  i happen to think it goes into their accounts in switzerland personallynow a lot of people say no no it used for terror and they use it for terror because it the number one terror funder  not even close but i also think that when you have 400 million in cash different denominations do you see the size of this i guess they did release the pictures after all they released picturesand interesting ill tell you i sort of think it goes into bank accounts right you know i sort of think they take it they probably use some for this some for that you can do a lot of thingsand obama said that he did it because we dont have a working account with iran do you believe that how long does it take to set up an account right you dont have a working account you set up an account rightyou set up an account and it takes about  look what going on in this country  folks folks what going on in this country is insane and we have people running our country that dont know what theyre doing theyre grossly incompetent and it time we have to make change real change not obama change we have to make changewhether it bergdahl we get bergdahl who was a traitor and they get five of the greatest killers that theyve wanted for eight years we get bergdahl  i call it the five for one trade for the iran deal where we get nothing we get nothingthey get ultimately they have the path beautiful path theyll get way way earlier than that theyll get nuclear weapons so if you get trump youre going to see a lot of changes to that deal thatll happen fast youre going to see some big changes and what i really  i mean i saw where president obama said that the 400 million in cash was not had nothing to do with the release of the hostages right it really doesnt work does it does it i mean remember obamacare youre going to keep your doctor youre going to keep your plan over and over again youre going to keep your doctor it was a lieand in fact if he didnt make the lie he would have never gotten it approved because most democrats many of the democrats didnt want to do it it was only that that got them to sign it and to approve it and it was a lieand the 400 million and from what the rumor is and from what the reports are the hostages couldnt leave the airport until this other plane arrived they dont know why but i think we all have a pretty good reason why it was all a big lie it was all a big lieand it so sad to see and let me tell you hillary clinton is going to be four more years of obama but maybe worse maybe worse therell be four more years four more years of isis four more years of high taxes you know yesterday i had a  at a big event really it turned out to be a very big event in detroit good event very good and we got wonderful reviews and a lot of good comments but the thing im doing im cutting taxes big league especially for the middle class and especially for businesses because businesses are dying and that means small businesses businesses period businesses are leaving our country like theyve never left before theyre going all over theyre going to mexico that i can tell you mexico is like the eighth wonder of the world you know ive been telling a story a friend of mine good friend of mine good guy he builds plants he builds plants for cars for computers you know where they make them massive plants and i said to him how are you doingand he worked in north carolina by the way i said to him how are you doing he said phenomenal he like i think the biggest in the world at this  that what he does great guy i said how it all going he said youve got to see mexico donald it the eighth wonder of the world what were building there is like never has been built weve never seen anything like itand i said how are we doing in the united states im more interested in that ok it ok i guess right you know america first folks america first america right america first america first we get a little tired of these deals where they actually put and you know why because of lobbyists and special interests and people representing and people wanting it to happen it just not that they want other countries to benefit over us there are reasons for it and you know when i raise money and im putting up a lot of money for my own campaign im funding meand im raising for the republican party and were getting a lot of money from the small donorsremember two months ago well i hadnt started i wanted to make sure i get the nomination before i start rightlet me get the nomination please and then i took a lot of heat from the press the world most dishonest people by the way  terrible  terrible those cameras will not move and show how many people are in this auditorium those cameras  those cameras are not going on the move unless we have a protester is there a protester up there in the quota any protesters if we had a protester that the only time they move because theyre showing something that in their mind is a bad thing so then they move but i like that ive always liked my protesters because the cameras show these massive crowds and people say wow was that a big crowdyou know i go home to my wife i say how it going she says darling your speech was very good were there

said the place is already full and rudy just said man ive never seen anything like that maybe a couple of days before an election but this is what happening because of the fact we have a movement

roberts and maybe they can get a stay let see what happens ok let see what happens that a very important thing but i wrote a few things down and to me so important  yes darling thank you unstable hillary lacks the judgment now bernie sanders said she lacks judgment right and nobody said anything about it no problem he said you lack judgment and  during one of the debates nobody said it was finewhen i say it they say that terrible the way you talk she does she lacks judgment she lacks temperament and im the one that used unfit many many months ago and now theyve turned it around use it on me unfit im unfit that  that a first but she lacks the temperament and the moral character to lead this country its very simpleshe really does she a dangerous person who doesnt tell the truth which has been proven very loudlyive never seen a  i dont think weve ever had greater proof of that of anybody and she has disregarded the lives of americans  you see what happening  with what she has done

free zonesdo you know what a gunfree zone is that like  they study where the gunfree zones  if they would have known you had guns if they would have known that they were going to be shot at from the other side it would have been a whole different story maybe it wouldnt have even happened in the first placeso they better not come here they better not they better not so recently a book came out a couple of weeks ago a secret service agent made a statement because she said the other day she shortcircuited hey could you imagine if i said that i short circuited they would be calling for my execution  electric chair theyd bring back the electric chair it would be a whole different ball game if i said it believe me but the secret service agent said she simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the office rightfrom the bottom of my soul he said i know this to be true her leadership style which is volcanic and impulsive and she makes bad decisions ok hey you know it one thing to make bad decisions it another thing to be wacky and make bad decisions she is disdainful of the rules set for everyone else and she hasnt changed a bit this is  that was the good thing i couldnt say the bad things it was too much nobody would even  nobody would even believe it youve got to see this book nobody would believe because it so terrible so terribleand she comes across like this woman  nice easy  but she not and  and she  listen  she not a leader not a leader and she is a liar hey hey  33000 emails are gone ok 33000 emails are gone theyre gone how do you get rid of 33000 emails who sends 33000 emails i mean 33  do you know how many that is i think that like 24 hours a day reading them or sending them but it wouldnt matter for years 33000 emails are missingand she so guilty she so guilty i think it a tremendous blot in our country i really mean that i think what happened over the last two weeks with respect to her especially in light of the fact that general petraeus and many others have suffered unbelievable consequences i think it a tremendous blot on our country a tremendous blot just remember thatbut i just looked at this  the economic failures of obama and clinton et cetera obamaclinton economic policies have produced 12 percent economic growth the weakest socalled recovery since the great depression now this is like unbelievable  12do you know china goes to 7 percent or 8 percent it like a national catastrophe now what they do is they cut their currencythey devalue their currency and big league and then all of our businesses continue to be drained out of the united states our money our jobs they make our product they sell our product to us no tax no nothing you devalue  see devaluing is sort of cheatingyou know it sort of like cheating now i have great relationships with china ive done great business with china ive done really well with china i have these tenants i sell condos i own the bank of america building in san francisco with a group a great group thank you maam got to win  got to win north carolina thank you thank you but they  it cheating it really cheating and when i look at these trade deals  it so sad  where we lose 800 billion  billion with b  dollars a year on trade with china alone it 400 billion and 500 billion and 505 billion this is year in and year out it actually amazing that our country keeps going but what has happened is we have people in the audience in 18 years theyre making less money now than they made 18 years ago in real wages 18and in many cases theyre working two and three jobs ok but theyre making less money now than they made 18 years ago and those stats come right out real wages theyre working harder theyre getting olderso in theory it supposed to be the other way you know you work and youre young you dont care get a little older it like oh by the way how about me i think im working harder too if you want to know i never worked this hard in my life but i like it i like it i love it actually because ive met so many incredible people you know i really got  thank you  i really got a tremendous understanding of this country because im going to places that ive heard about ive known about im stopping everywhere and i see the carnage that nafta has caused i see the carnage it been horrible i see upstate new york i see north carolina but i see every state you look at new england new england got really whacked new england got hityou look at ohio what happened there and still happening by the way this isnt like it going to happen or it all over it getting worse you look at ohio you look at michigan what going on with the car plants being built in mexico is unbelievableand more and more you know theyre moving we were just talking about the autoworkers yesterday where theyve lost over 100000 autoworkers in michigan the state of michigan which is our car capital and it really not the car capital anymore mexico will become the new car capital of the world in a very short period of time no think of itand that only because we allow it to happen and i like mexico and i respect the leaders of mexico because theyre much smarter theyre much street smarter but theyre much smarter and more cunning than our leaders but you have to see what going on and one of the reasons i won indiana was bobby knight because he the best he the greatest but one of the reasons is that carrier air conditioning let 1400 people go and theyre building a plant in mexico and were not going to let it happen   it a suicidal pact for our country and you know ive watched for yearsi was never a politician until 14 months ago so i cant believe im saying im a politician cant believe it but  but ive been watching for years and ive watched as  as the government tries to keep businesses from leaving our country and going to other countries and ive seen low interest loans ive seen zero interest loans ive seen all sorts of subsidiesi get it that stuff not gonna work that not gonna work what gonna work is  as an example carrier moves to mexico and you wish him a lot of luck good luck have a nice plant i hope my friend bills it rightand then you know what happens when they make their air conditioners  and then think theyre gonna sell that air conditioner people living in indianapolis  where they come from  for a similar priceand they think theyre gonna sell it there and have no repercussions with me they have repercussions ok with me they have repercussions with me we inform them that if you move youre gonna pay a 35 percent tax on every single air conditioner that pour across our now very secure borders and two things are gonna happen one of two things  one of two things are gonna happen number one if you get them in time theyre not moving throws it all offbalance since theyre all offkilter number one theyre not  now nobody  people would say well why doesnt anybody use this why doesnt anybody mention itill tell you why because theyre controlled by their lobbyists theyre politicians and carrier goes out or whoever it might be this  im just using carrier as an example its hundreds and thousands its thousands of companyand millions of jobs were talking about i was looking at numbers  im not gonna repeat the numbers because theyll say i was wrong it cant be that high i couldnt believe it was that high but it thousands of companies and millions and millions of jobsand youd say why arent  like why doesnt somebody else say what trump is saying so im controlled by myself because im putting up my money ok im putting up my money butalthough we raised did you see 82 million last month 82 million last month and a lot of it  a lot of the money was the small donations which republicans never get a lot of them  i think it averaged 61 a hit 61 can you imagine that the total that we raised and in fact in may i told you i was taking heat because they said donald trump didnt raise any moneyand they told you why right i didnt raise it because i didnt know  i gotta make sure i got the nomination if i didnt get the nomination i wouldve gone to turnberry and played golf ok in scotland but you know what i got the nomination so now i had a start and we raised 51 million in june right a lot of it in small donations and we raised 82 million in julypeople are going even the haters back there the people that truly hate trump  they said that amazing so were doing all right and people look they want  they wanna hear this message because this is a message this is an important messagebut when you say  and when you hear what i just said  you charge a tariff or a tax and guess what and people said why hasnt the  why havent the politicians theyre smart why havent they done itbecause theyre controlled by people that work for many of these companies and theyre not gonna do it whether it donors or whether its special interests or lobbyists they control because they want it to happenand honestly i think it a total disgracei think it a total disgrace for the millions of jobs and for the thousands and thousands of companies that have left our country if i were here to speak to every one of those companies for five minutes  bye byethey were so quiet you know i like the hillary protesters you know why theyre so nice and quiet the bernie protesters were brutal they were tough right the hillary protesters had no spirit did you see thatshe starts screaming and the guy walks up ill go the bernie ones were  they had a lot more spirit i think were going to get a lot of bernie voters if you want to know the truth because they do understand that trade is killing us trade so a few things a few other facts i wrote which i think are amazing one is the 12 percent lowest in you know forget it that not a recovery it probably much  dont forget when they announced 12 percent that means it lower and 12 is starting to set recordsthe national debt  so were up to almost 20 trillion  20 trillion! the national debt under obama has doubled think of it doubled might be i think by the time he gets out it going to more than double but again we have to very accuratebecause ill say  theyll say well it hasnt quite doubled believe me by the time he gets out it will have more than doubledthe national debt has doubled and you know the bad part about that you think if the national debt has doubled our infrastructure would be great our country would be in great shapewed have beautiful roads beautiful highways you see where like 50 percent of the bridges are in danger in this country and the roadways are a messi have a friend he in the trucking business he said you know for years he had no problem now he buys these big beautiful trucks and the wheels get wiped out because of the potholes on the highways and things that he never had so you think with all of that doubling of the national debt youd really think that wed be in good shape from the infrastructure standpoint right were not were in very bad shapeus trade deficit 800  almost 800 billion nearly 24 million americans in their prime earning years are out of the labor force rightin the last seven years another 14 million people have left the work force think of it these are the real numbers not the 5 percent nonsenseyou know you look for a job you cant find your job you go home you share you go to your parents you go to your friends you do whatever you gave up and now youre considered  statistically youre considered employedthose people are not employed these are great people and there are plenty of them in herei mean we have great people we have the most loyal people we have the smartest people you know so many of my people theyre so smartthey like to say well trump i dont know if he got this right  let me tell you we have the smartest people we have the people that are the smartest and the strongest and the best and the hardest working we have the smartest people well put iqs among  some of us we couldnt say all of us right  against any iqs that we  we have to deal with   in the last seven years 14 million one in five american households do not have a single member in the workforce pretty badhomeownership  this is one that is amazing to me  today homeownership is at its lowest rate in 51 yearsso you own homes i mean it always used to be the dream to own a home right the american homelowest that its been in so many years 51 years nearly 12 million people and more americans are dependent on food stamps and 2 million more latino americans live in poverty under obama and clinton  under obama because clinton just gonna carry onyou know i dont know if you saw i gave a massive tax decrease yesterday at regulations were gonna get rid of so many of them but clinton is gonna double your taxes she gonna double up your taxesand she trying to say well i dont know like trump way  she gonna double up your taxes youre gonna have massive tax increases is clinton gets in enjoy  enjoy it folks if that happensfifty eight percent of african american youth are not employed how sad is that american households are earning 4000 less  listen to this one today  than they were 16 years ago many workers are earning less than 1970 in real dollarsso 1970  that a long time ago right theyre earning in real dollars less money so under my plan were gonna create millions of new and really good paying jobs you know it interesting because even the proobama people say about the jobs that theyre bad jobsive heard it from many of the people theyre trying to defend him but they say theyre bad jobs theyre not good jobs the good jobs  the good jobs have left but well create millions of new good paying jobs but good jobsthat so important that so important everyone taxes will go down hillary clinton has supported tax increases on the middle class for her entire career she voted for higher taxes 235 times in the senate that all i thought it was more than that 235 times i hope there not a decimal point in there or so 235 timesbut i dont think there is  voted for higher taxes 235 times in the senate now she planning another job killing  13 trillion tax increase that what her tax increase is gonna be folks like youre not paying enough righther plan will tax many small business  businesses who are already in deep trouble out of business then we have  we will make  and this is so important this was an ivanka trump ok my daughter so great so great were gonna make childcare expenses tax deductible for working families and just many many other things i mean were gonna make some unbelievable changes and it  it so easy again you know regulations  im traveling all over and im meeting with business owners  and beyond business owners even people that work at the businesses theyre being laid off because of itregulations if i told you  and im so surprised this is probably the biggest surprise  if you have a small business and i said you can have one or the other a major tax cut like were gonna  you know were bringing it down to 15 percent from more than  much more than double thatbut if i told you that you could have a massive tax decrease or really substantially  but in a real way  cut regulations  a hundred percent of the people i talk to would take the regulation if you could only have one or the other it amazing its amazingand that surprised me surprised you too surprised him too a hundred percent i mean everybody  businesses cant form anymore the tax  the regulatory burden is so incredible that you cant form businesses  very hard  and businesses that are in existence are being put out of existence for regulations that dont do anything we want safety regulations we want environmental regulations were not you know people that dont want these things we have to have thatwe want clear air we want clean water we want clear water but  butto do that  and there are certain things that you want to do but to do that you dont have to destroy our country and destroy our businesses so you know i just wrote this down today hillary wants to raise taxes it a comparison i want to lower them hillary wants to expand regulations which she does big league can you believe that i will reduce them very very substantially could be as much as 70 75 percent hillary wants to shut down energy production i want to expand it lower electric  lower electric bills folks hillary wants to abolish  essentially abolish the second amendment by the way and if she gets to pick if she gets to pick her judges nothing you can do folks although the second amendment people maybe there is i dont know but  but ill tell you what that will be a horrible day if  if hillary gets to put her judges  right now were tied you see what going onyou see what going on we tied because scalia  this was not suppose to happen justice scalia was going to be around for ten more years at least and this is what happens that was a horrible thingso now look at it so hillary essentially wants to abolish the second amendment now speaking to the nra folks  who are great  when you  when you  and ill tell you they endorsed me they endorsed me very early my son a member im a memberif you  we can add i think the national rifle association we can add the second amendment to the justices  they almost go  in a certain way hand in hand now the justices are going to do things that are so important and we have such great justices you saw my list of 11 that have been vetted and respected and have gotten great and they to a little equate  but if you dont do the right thing either youre not going to have a second amendment or youre not going to have much of it left and youre not going to be able to protect yourself which you needyou know when the bad guys burst into your house theyre not looking about into second amendments and do i have the right to do this ok the bad guys arent going to be giving up their weaponsbut the good people will say oh well that the law no no not going to happen we cant let it happen we cant let it happen hillary clinton wants to have totally open borders where people flow into our country where they flow into our country and they take your jobs and they do lots of things and i want people to come into our country but they have to do it through a process they have to do it legally right so you have drugs pouring in you have everything coming inyou know in new hampshire a great state they have a tremendous heroin problem i said to them we will stop the drugs from pouring in to our country from the southern border theyre going to stop and by the way we will build a wall that legal walls do work walls do work now here one and you know  i mean she doesnt look that way but she is  hillary wants to invade foreign countries that what she does and look at the mess so weve spent  you know for two years for three years ive been saying we spent 2 trillion right in iraq more now i guess somebody actually said to me the other day that they were talking about four or five trillion in the middle eastand im going to get the accurate number they dont know the accurate number the truth is they have no idea they have no idea what were doing were sending equipment over the enemies take it in we sent over 2300 humvees that are totally armor plated they got stolen by the enemy 2300 i thought they meant like two or 23or 230 was too much 2300 humvees and they got stolen they got taken by the enemy you know shot guns fired in the air the ones we gave to the socalled allies these great allies that we always pick who end up being worse than the guys who were trying to get out so terrible hillary and president obama refused to use the term radical islamic terrorism big problem big problem hillary wants to release violent criminals and criminal offenders from prison that wonderful enjoy yourselves i want to work with our police our police are so incredible theyre not getting the respect they deserve not getting the respect they deserve and were going to in our country restore law and order we have to we have to restore law and order and the police are going to be careful and theyre going to be studied and theyre going to be  but we have to restore law and order what happened in dallas where all of those people were shot down absolutely absolutely for no reason viciously shot down and so many others i was with one of the police groups the other day theyre endorsing meof like eight other states in the last short while where the same smaller number but the same thing was happening where police are being killed we have to respect and cherish our police school choice we want common core we dont want weve got to get rid of common core bring educationaland folks and we have to renegotiate with nafta and by the way going back to the wall mexico is going to pay for the wall that i can tell you listen you know these politicians they dont know me they dont understand me and i am im in a group of 50 people these are real geniuses these are 50 people that have been running our country forever and they said we cant support donald trump the reason they cant you know why because im not going to hire these people i dont want these peopletake a look take a look at what these people  these are sort of like the people that have been involved with washington making decisions militarily on defense on other things  take a look what has happened in our country our military is depleted our vets arent taken care ofwe cant beat isis can you imagine general george patton who is right now spinning in his grave the great general douglas macarthur  can you imagine  and i say because we have so many military people and this is such a military state and i love it i love but can you imagine them seeing that we cant beat these 25 or 30000 people we cant beat them were fighting a political correct warit a political correct war i mean you know what going on you know what going on these are people that chop off heads these are people that in steel cages drop steel cages into the waters and drowned large numbers of peoplethese are people that buried people in the sand weve got to knock them outi was against the war in iraq we shouldnt have been to the war in iraq it destabilized the middle east and i said that was going to happen but we shouldnt have gotten out the way we got outthe way we got out was insane and obama gave a date and he  and that how isis happened folks hence the birth of isis congratulations hillary clinton congratulate  i mean she  she should get  if im isis i call her up and i give her the most valuable player award ok and i guarantee you with libya which was her baby and all of the other mistakes she has made obama takes now because obviously for him that the better alternative all right but he has been an incompetent president he has done a horrible job  and i guarantee you that if he had it to it again  and he would only say this to his wife  but if he had it to do again he would not have chosen hillary clinton to be his secretary of state because she made so many horrible mistakes and cost so many livesand i mean lives on both sides im not just saying  i mean lives on both sides she inept she ineptand to think that she is even allowed to run for the presidency of the united states when she deleted and got rid of 33000 emails is an embarrassment to our country and it always will be ok it always will be so  so i want to thank all of you for being here look im going to be around and were going to be coming to north carolina a lot got to win it very important but

68,thank you everybody thank you very much it great to be with you this afternoon and today we begin a conversation on how to make america safe again in the twentieth century the united states has defeated fascism nazism and communism now a different threat faces our world radical islamic terrorismthis summer there been an isis attack launched outside the warzones of the middle easthard to believeevery eightyfour hours here in america we have seen one brutal attack after another thirteen were murdered and thirtyeight wounded in the assault on fort hood the boston marathon bombing wounded and maimed sixtyfour people and ultimately left five dead including two of our great police officers  in chattanooga tennessee five unarmed marinesunbelievable people by the waywere shot and killed at a military recruiting centerlast september fourteen innocent americans were gunned down at an office party in san bernardino another twentytwo were very gravely injured in june fortynine americans were executed at the pulse nightclub in orlando  another fiftythree were badly injured it was the worst mass shooting in our history and the attack by far the worst on the lgbtq community and ill tell you what we can never ever allow this to happen again in europethank youin europe we have seen the same carnage and bloodshed afflicted upon our closest allies in january of 2015 a french satirical newspaper charlie hebdo was attacked for publishing cartoons of the prophet mohammed twelve were killed including two police officers and 11 were wounded two days later four were murdered in a jewish delicatessen in november of 2015 terrorist went on a shooting rampage in paris that slaughtered 130 people and wounded another 368 people some in very very very bad shape todayfrance is suffering gravely and the tourism industry is being massively affected in the most negative way in march of this year terrorists detonated a bomb in brussels airport killing 32 and injuring 340 people this july in the south of france an islamic terrorist turned his truck into an instrument of mass murder plowing down and killing 85 men women and children and wounding 308 peopleterrible among the dead were two americans a texas father and his 11yearold son a few weeks ago in germany a refugee armed with an axe wounded 5 people in a gruesome train attack only days ago an isis killer invaded a christian church in normandy france forced an 85 yearold priest to his knees a priest who was beloved who was beloved before cutting his throat and just unthinkable other thingsoverseas isis has carried out an absolute atrocity and one after another children slaughtered girls sold into slavery men and women burned alive crucifixions beheadings and drownings ethnic minorities targeted for mass execution holy sites desecrated christians driven from their homes and hunted for extermination isis rounding up what it calls nation of the cross nation of the cross in a campaign of absolute and total genocidewe cannot let this evil continue  thank you thank younor can we let the hateful ideology of radical islam it oppression of women gays children and nonbelievers be allowed to reside or spread within our own countries  we will defeat radical islamic terrorism just as we have defeated every threat weve faced at every age and before but we will not we will not remember this defeat it with closed eyes or silenced voices we have a president that doesnt want to say the wordsanyone who cannot name our enemy is not fit to lead our country  anyone who cannot condemn the hatred oppression and violence of radical islam lacks the moral clarity to serve as our president  the rise of isis is the direct result of policy decisions made by president obama and secretary of state clinton let look back at the middle east at the very beginning of 2009 before the obamaclinton administration took overlibya was stable syria was under control egypt was ruled by a secular president and an ally of the united statesiraq was experiencing a reduction in violence the group that would become what we now call isis was close to being extinguished iran was being choked off by economic sanctionsfast forward to today what we haveand think of thisand the decisions made by the obama/clinton group have been absolutely disastrouslibya is in ruins our ambassador and three other really brave americans are dead and isis has gained a new base of operationssyria is in the midst of a disastrous civil war isis controls large portions of territory a refugee crisis now threatens europe and the united statesin egypt terrorists have gained a foothold in the sinai desert near the suez canal one of the most essential waterways of the world iraq is in chaos and isis is on the loose isis has spread across the middle east and into the westin 2014 isis was operating in seven nations they were in seven nations terrible but that what it wastoday theyre fully operational in 18 countries with aspiring branches in six more for a total of 24 and many believe that number is actually 28 to 30 countries they dont even knowthe situation is likely worse than the public has any idea a new congressional report reveals that the administration has downplayed the growth of isis with 40 percent of analysts saying they had experience efforts to manipulate their findings in trying to make it look much better than it is it badat the same time isis is trying to infiltrate refugee flows into europe and to the united states iran the world largest state sponsor of terrorism is not flush with 150 billion in cash released by the united states plus if you remember from two weeks ago another 400 million in actual cash that was obviously used for ransomworst of all the nuclear deal puts iran the number one state sponsor of radical islamic terrorism on a path to nuclear weapons in short the obama/clinton foreign policy has unleashed isis destabilized the middle east and put the nation of iran which chants death to america in a dominant position of regional power and in fact aspiring a dominant world powerit all began in 2009 with what has become known as president obama global apology tour we all remember we all remember  in a series of speeches president obama described america as arrogant dismissive derisive and a colonial power he was describing ushe informed other countries that he would be speaking up about america past errors he pledged that we would no longer be a senior partner that sought to dictate our terms he lectured cia officers of the need to acknowledge their mistakes and described guantanamo bay as a rallying cry for our enemiesperhaps no speech was more misguided than president obama speech to the muslim world delivered in cairo egypt 2009 i remember it wellin winning the cold war president ronald reagan repeatedly touted the superiority of freedom over communism and called the ussr the evil empire yet when president obama delivered his address in cairo no such moral courage could be found or would be found instead of condemning the oppression of women and gays in many muslim nations and the systematic violations of human rights or the financing of global terrorism president obama tried to draw an equivalency between our human rights recordand remember this our human rightsand theirsthe records are unbelievable and unmistakablehis naive words were followed by even more naive actions the failure to establish a new status of forces agreement in iraq and the electiondriven timetable for withdrawal surrendered our gains in that country and led directly to the rise of isis without question the failures in iraq were compounded by hillary clinton disaster total disaster in libya president obama has since said that he regrets and really regrets libya and the mistake he made he considers it his worst mistake according to thensecretary of defense robert gates the invasion of libya was nearly a split decision but hillary clinton forceful advocacy for the intervention was the deciding factor that why we went inwith one episode of bad judgment after another hillary clinton policies launched isis onto the world stage yet as she threw the middle east into violent turmoil things turned out really to be not so hot for our world and our country the middle east in particularthe clintons made almost 60000 in gross income while she was secretary of state it is unbelievable incident after incident proves again and again hillary clinton lacks the judgmentas said by bernie sandersstability and temperament and the moral character to lead our nation importantly she also lacks the mental and physical stamina to take on isis and all of the many adversaries we face not only in terrorism but in trade and every other challenge we must confront to turn our great country around it is now time for a new approach our current strategy of nation building and regimechange is a proven absolute failure we have created the vacuums that allow terrorism to grow and thrive i was an opponent of the iraq war from the beginning a major difference between me and my opponent though i was a private citizen whose personal opinions on such matters were really not sought i nonetheless publicly expressed my private doubts about the invasion i was against believe methree months before the invasion i said in an interview with neil cavuto to whom i offer my best wishes for a speedy recovery that perhaps we shouldnt be doing it yet and that the economy is a much bigger problemin august of 2004 very early right after the conflict i made a detailed statement to esquire magazine in an interview here the quote in full look at the war in iraq and the mess were in i would never have handled it that way this was right after the invasion does anybody really believe that iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to go and step up and lead the country cmoni then continued two minutes after we leave there going to be a revolution and the meanest toughest smartest most viscous guy in this case guy will take over and hell have weapons of mass destruction which saddam hussein did not havewhat was the purpose of this whole thing hundreds and hundreds of young people killed and what about the people coming back with no arms and no legs not to mention in all fairness the other side the tremendous damage done all those iraqi kids whove been blown to pieces and it turns out that all of the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong all of this death and destruction for nothingso ive been clear for a long time that we should not have gone in but i have been just as clear in saying what a catastrophic mistake hillary clinton and president obama made with the reckless way in which they pulled outafter we had made those hard fought sacrifices and gains we should have never made such a sudden withdrawal on a timetable advertised to our enemies they said were moving out here our time here our date who would do this but an incompetent presidental qaeda in iraq had been decimated and obama and clinton gave it new life and allowed it to spread all across the world by that same token president obama and hillary clinton should have never attempted to build a democracy in libya to push for immediate regime change in syria or to support the overthrow of mubarak in egyptone more point on this i have long said that we should have kept the oil in iraq  i said it over and over and over again another area where my judgment has been proven correct i just said it so many times virtually every time i was interviewed keep the oil keep the oilaccording to cnn isis made as much as 500000 in oil sales in 2014 alone that before they really got started fueling and funding its reign of terror if we had controlled the oil like i said we should we could have prevented the rise of isis in iraq both by cutting off a major source of funding and through the presence of us forces necessary to safeguard the oil and vital infrastructure products necessary for us to have the oili was saying this constantly and consistently to whomever would listen i said keep the oil keep the oil keep the oil dont let somebody else get it  if they had listened to me then we would have had the economic benefits of the oil which i wanted to use to help take care of the wounded soldiers and families of those who died in the war  in addition to which thousands of lives would have been saved this proposal by its very nature would have left soldiers in place of our assets we would have had soldiers there guarding this valuable supply of oil in the old days when we won a war to the victor belonged the spoils  instead all we got from iraq and our ventures in the middle east was death destruction and tremendous financial loss but it time to put the mistakes of the past behind us and chart a new course if i become president the era of nationbuilding will be brought to a very swift and decisive end  thank you our new approachwhich must be shared by both parties in america by our allies overseas and by our friends in the middle eastmust be to halt the spread of radical islam all actions should be oriented around this goal and any country which shares this goal will be our ally very important some dont share this goal we cannot always choose our friends but we can never fail to recognize our enemies as president i will call for an international conference focused on this goal we will work side by side with our friends in the middle east including our greatest ally israel  we will partner with king abdullah of jordan and the president of egypt president sisi and all others who recognize this ideology of death that must be extinguished we will also work very closely with nato on this new mission i had previously said that nato was obsolete because it failed to deal adequately with terrorism since my comments they have changed their policy and now have a new division focused on terror threats very good very very goodi also believe that we could find common ground with russia in a fight against isis wouldnt that be a good thing wouldnt that be a good thing  they too have much at stake in the outcome in syria and have had their own battles with islamic terrorism just as bad as ours they have a big big problem in russia with isismy administration will aggressively pursue joint and coalition military operations to crush and destroy isis international cooperation to cut off their funding expanded intelligence sharing and cyber warfare to disrupt and disable their propaganda and recruiting their recruiting is taking place right now and theyre setting records it got to be stopped we cannot allow the internet to be used as a recruiting tool and for other purposes by our enemy we must shut down their access to this form of communication and we must do it immediatelyimmediately unlike hilary clinton who has risked so many lives with her careless of handling of sensitive information my administration will not telegram exactly military plans and what they are  and by the way what happened with her 33000 emails is an absolute disgrace to the united states of america ive often said that the great general douglas macarthu and the great general george patton would be in a state of shock if they were alive today to see the way president obama and hillary clinton tried to recklessly announce their every move before it happens like they did in iraq so that the enemy can prepare and adapt their enemy says thank youthe fight will not be limited to isis we will decimate alqaeda and we will seek to starve funding for iranbacked hamas and hezbollah  so important we can use existing un security council resolutions to apply new and even stronger sanctions military cyber and financial warfare will all be necessary to dismantle islamic terrorismbut we must use ideological warfare as well very important and they use it on us better than we have ever even thought of using it on them but that will changejust as we won just as we won the cold war in part by exposing the evils of communism and the virtues of free markets so too must we take on the ideology of radical islam while my opponent accepted millions of dollars in foundation donations from countries where being gay is an offense punishable by prison or death my administration will speak out against the oppression of women gays and people of different beliefs our administration would be a friend to all moderate muslim reformers in the middle east and will amplify their voices this includes speaking out against the horrible practice of honor killings where women are murdered by their relatives for dressing marrying or acting in a way that violates fundamentalist teachings over 1000 pakistani girls are estimated to be the victims of honor killings by their relatives each yearrecently a prominent pakistani social media star was strangled to death by her brother on the charge of dishonoring the family in his confession the brother took pride in the murder and said girls are born to stay home and follow traditions shockingly this is a tradition that has reached our own shores one such case and many many cases have happenedwhere one involves an iraqi immigrant who was sentenced to 34 years in jail for running over his own daughter claiming she had been too westernizedto defeat islamic terrorism we must also speak our forcefully against a hateful ideology that provides the breeding ground for violence and terrorism to grow it a breeding ground it a terrible terrible breeding grounda new immigration policy is needed immediately and as well  the common thread linking the major islamic terror attacks that have recently occurred on our soil9/11 the fort hood shooting the boston bombing the san bernardino attack the orlando attackis that they have involved immigrants or the children of immigrantsclearly new screening procedures are needed a review by the us senate immigration subcommittee has identified 380 foreignborn individuals charged with terrorism or terrorismrelated offenses between 9/11 and 2014 and many more since then and this year is a record for identification it gotten worse far worsewe also know that isis recruits refugees after their entrance into the country as we have seen with the somali refugee population in minnesotabeyond terrorism as we have also seen in france foreign populations have brought their antisemitic attitudes with them in cologne germany on new years we have seen the reports of sexual violence and assault far greater than anybody knowspew polling shows that in many of the countries from which we draw large number of immigrantsextreme views about religion such death penaltyand for those who are involvedthe death penalty is very very common if you dont have the faith that they demand you havea trump administration will establish a clear principle that will govern all decisions pertaining to immigration and we will be tough and we will be even extreme  we should only admit into this country those who share our values and respect our people in the cold war we had an ideological screening test the time is overdue to develop a new screening test for the threats we face today i call it extreme vetting i call it extremeextreme vettingour country has enough problems we dont need more and these are problems like weve never had before ] in addition to screening out all members of the sympathizers we must also screen out any with hostile attitudes toward our country or its principles or who believe that sharia law should supplant american law  those who do not believe in our constitution or who support bigotry or hatred will not be admitted for immigration into our country  only those who we expect to flourish in our country and to embrace a tolerant american society should be issued visas  to put these new procedures in place we will have to temporarily suspend immigration from some of the most dangerous and volatile regions of the world that have a history of exporting terrorism nor for us! not for us thank you thank you as soon as i take office i will ask the state department and the department of homeland security to identify a list of regions where adequate screening cannot take place there are many such regions we will stop processing visas from those areas until such time as it is deemed safe to resume based on new circumstances or new procedures the size of current immigration flows are simply too large to perform adequate screening  we admit about 100000 permanent immigrants from the middle east every year  beyond that we admit hundreds of thousands of temporary workers and visitors from the same regionshundreds of thousands  if we dont control the numbers we cant perform adequate screening there no way it can take place by contrast my opponent wants to increasewhich is unbelievable no matter who you are where you come fromwants to increase the flow of syrian refugees by 550 over what they are now  the united states senate subcommittee on immigration estimates that hillary plan would mean roughly 620000 refugees from all current refugeesending nations in her first term  assuming no cuts to other refugee programsso it could get worse! this would be additional to all other nonrefugee immigration unbelievable numbers unbelievable numbers the subcommittee estimates her plan would impose a lifetime cost of roughly 400 billion when you include the cost of healthcare welfare housing schooling and other entitlement benefits that are excluded from the state department placement figures think of this 400 billion in short hillary clinton wants to be america angela merkel  and you know what a disaster this massive immigration has been to germany and the people of germany crime has risen to levels that no one thought they would ever ever see it is a catastrophe we have enough problems in our country we dont need morelastly we will need to restore common sense to our security procedures another common feature of the past attacks that have occurred on our soil is that warning signs were totally ignored the 9/11 hijackers had fraud all over their visa applications almost every one of them it said practically in big bold letters fraud and nobody saw it the russians warned us about the boston bombers here on political asylum and the attackers were even twice interviewed by the fbi very sadthe female san bernardino shooter on heron her statements and everything that she said she was here on a fiance visa which most people have not even heard of from saudi arabia and she wanted to support very openly jihad online these are the people were taking ina neighbor saw suspicious behaviorbombs on the floor and other thingsbut didnt warn authorities because they said they didnt want to be accused of racial profiling now many are dead and many more are gravely woundedthe shooter in orlando reportedly celebrated in his classroom after 9/11  he too was interviewed by the fbi his father a native of afghanistan supported the oppressive taliban regime and expressed antiamerican views very strongly  and by the way was just seen sitting behind hillary clinton with a big fat smile on his face all the way through her speech  he obviously liked what she had to say it called weakness weakness it called stupidity and weve had it the fort hood shooter delivered a presentation to a room full of mental health experts before the attacks in which he threw out one red flag after another he even proclaimed that we love death more then you love life not good these warning signs were ignored because political correctness has replaced common sense in our society  thank you thank youthat is why one of my first acts as president will be to establish a commission on radical islam which will include reformers voices in the muslim community who will hopefully work with us we want to build bridges and erase divisions the goal of the commission will be to identify and explain to the american public the core convictions and beliefs of radical islam to identify the warning signs of radicalization and to expose the networks in our society that support radicalization this commission will be used to develop new protocols for local police officers federal investigators and immigration screeners and while im at it we should give a hand to our great police officers and law enforcement officials  thank you thank youwe will also keep open guantanamo bay and place a renewed emphasis on human intelligence drone strikes will remain part of our strategy but we will also seek to capture highvalue targets to gain needed information to dismantle their organizations  foreign combatants will be tried in military commissions finally we will pursue aggressive criminal or immigration charges against anyone who lends materiel support to terrorism there will be consequences for those people there will be very serious consequences  similar to the effort to take down the mafia this will be the understood mission of every federal investigator and prosecutor in the country  to accomplish a goal you must state a mission the support networks for radical islam in this country will be stripped out and removed onebyone viciously if necessaryviciously if necessary immigration offices will also have their powers restored those have been taken away those who are guests in our country that are preaching hate will be asked to return home immediately and if they dont immediately we will return them hometo make america safe again we must work together again our victory in the cold war relied on a bipartisan and international consensus that is what we must have to defeat radical islamic terrorism but just like we couldnt defeat communism without acknowledging that communism exists or explaining its horrible evils we cant defeat radical islamic terrorism unless we do the exact same thing we have to explain that it exists and explain the difficulties we have to have a leader that can do that and we do not have that nowbut this also means that we have to promote the exceptional virtues of our own way of life we have an exceptional country an exceptional way of life but it being tread on by sick sick people and expecting that as newcomers come into our society they will likewise have respect and do the same pride in our institutions our history and our values should be taught by parents and teachers and impressed upon all of those that come into our society and want to join our society assimilation is not an act of hostility but an expression of compassion our system of government and our american culture is the best in the world and well produce the best outcomes for all who adopt it  thank you thank youthis approach will not only make us safer but bring us closer together as a country renewing the spirit of americanism will help heal the divisions in our country of which there are so many we have a divider as president we call him the great divider it the thing he best  it will do so by emphasizing what we have in common not what pulls us apartthis is my pledge to the american people as your president i will be your single greatest champion i will fight to ensure that every american is treated equally protected equally and honored equally  we will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its ugly forms and seek a new future built on our common culture and values as one american people only this way will we make america great again and safe againfor everyone thank you very much god bless you thank you thank you thank you
